 IRE_totalist_party_long: "Saor Éire\n§gSaor Éire, meaning \"Free Ireland\", was formed by Peadar O'Donnell after his ejection from Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin following the British Revolution, when the left wing of the party was purged due to the anti-socialist fervour in Ireland at the time.\n\nAs far as Saor Éire are concerned, the Irish Revolution of the early 1920s was one of the worst missed opportunities in Irish history, even by their own standards. They believe had only the masses just been a little more educated, a little more informed, just a little bit more class conscious, a Worker's Republic could have been achieved, instead of the \"bourgeois\" one that took its place. For Saor Éire, imperialism and capitalism are two sides of the same exploitative force, one which must be violently purged from Ireland. Related to this, is an intense distrust of the clergy from within the party, particularly their conservatism and \"trappings of wealth and excess\".\n\nThe ranks of Saor Éire are filled with bitter veterans of the War of Independence, who make up the resurrected underground paramilitary wing of the party, the Irish Citizen Army. However, their progress has been stunted for years by two major stumbling blocks: Firstly, the rather robust nature of the reactionary Irish state, which has done what it can to dissolve the party, and secondly, the constant internal bickering over how involved the Union of Britain should be in their struggle. Saor Éire attempt to appeal to the poorest in Irish society, particularly farmers and farm workers, and their vision for the future is as agrarian as it is militant and radical.§!\n"
 IRE_syndicalist_party_text: "§gThe Irish Syndicalist Party was founded during the War of Independence by Roddy Connolly, son of the martyred James Connolly, following his return from the Commune of France after being there seeking international support for Ireland's revolution. This iteration was quickly put down by the British government, and the party was later revived by Jim Larkin Jnr. in the late 1920s, as a spiritual successor to his father's banned party, the Irish Worker's League. The ISP espouses the beliefs of orthodox syndicalism and republicanism, and sees itself as continuing the legacy of James Connolly's efforts in 1916, and the several small Soviets that formed during the War of Independence.\n\nOne of the major challenges in the implementation of syndicalism in Ireland is the lack of a major industrial base, and in an effort to combat this, the ISP has been in discussion the France and Britain, in seeking international support for building up Ireland's industry, should the party's revolutionary efforts come to fruition. While officially banned, the party is led by Jim Larkin Snr., and is largely made up of the more radical former Labour Party and trade union members who have been expelled from their respective organisations due their more ardent socialist leanings. Being very much an internationalist party, the ISP's goals can be summarised by James Connolly himself; \"For our demands most moderate are, we only want the earth.\"§!\n"
 IRE_radical_socialist_party_text: "§gThe Progressive Labour Party are the newest political party in Ireland, formed out of the anti-radical purges performed in the Labour Party. Of course if you were to ask their founder, former student activist Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, he would have left the party because of opposition to the purges regardless. Made up of much of the former student wing of Labour, as well as some more senior dissidents within the party, the PLP take a dim view on any form of repression of civil liberties. Unsurprisingly, this puts them at odds with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, but their non-confrontational parliamentary demeanour has meant that their existence is tolerated, for now.\n\nTheir policies on social justice include supporting the abolition of the death penalty, removal of all political censorship, protections of freedom of speech, and pro-feminism views. Campaigning for a more encompassing welfare state than the mainstream Labour Party, with whom they share the belief of workers' rights, they also promote large scale formation of cooperative businesses and encourage farm collectivisation. They are noted to be avowedly pacifist in international terms and be willing to work with other left-wing parties owing to their small support base mostly consisting of the same kind of young progressives that make up the party itself.§!\n"

 IRE_social_democrat_party_text: "§g$IRE_social_democrat_party_text_start$\n\nShocked by the British Revolution, the Labour Party have now eschewed the revolutionary methods of abroad, for purely reformist means. This, as well as the anti-syndicalist measures taken from within the party to root out potential entryism, has led to several prominent members leaving in disagreement, from both the more militant and more liberal wings.\n\nAlongside worker's rights, Labour's policies include widespread social and industrial reform, brought about by income redistribution, extensive infrastructure projects, and publicly-owned universal public services. Their main support comes from Ireland's limited urban industrial base, but their progressive policies have consistently attracted the attention of a small number of the more liberal upper-middle class.§!\n"
 IRE_social_liberal_party_long: "$IRE_social_liberal_party_short$\n§gThe recently founded Clann na Talmhan, or \"Family of the Land\", would have more in common with the agrarian parties of Eastern Europe than other \"liberal\" parties. Formed in response to disillusionment against the more urban-focused government, and the perceived favouring of their more wealthy counterparts, the party's support is based around promoting the interests of the smaller farmers, particularly in the west of the country. Often considered somewhat anti-establishment and populist, they are regularly heard in Leinster House bemoaning the state of rural Ireland, and criticising all those who have it all, and who don't do enough for the man who lives and works on the land.\n\nIn practical terms, they call for land reclamation, lowering the taxes on farming land, and greater afforestation. Officially the party also supports social democratic policies such as state-funded secondary and subsidised university education, as well as publicly-owned healthcare. However, these are not seen as a priority for their limited support base, which unsurprisingly finds itself to be predominantly conservative and rural.§!\n"
 IRE_market_liberal_party_text: "§gThe National Development Party was founded by Seán Lemass in 1932, after he left Sinn Féin due to his disillusionment with the Collins administrations' further consolidation of power, and repression of radical politics. Being the only sitting TD to leave the party at the time, the NDP was set up alongside the unlikely partners of the National League Party and National Centre Party, both very small remnants of the old Irish Parliamentary Party, who favoured autonomy within the United Kingdom as opposed to independence.\n\nThe fledgling party's support is composed therefore of some members of the Anglo-Irish community, the more wealthy \"big farmers\", and parts of the urban middle class, as well as Lemass' small cohort of followers from Sinn Féin. Such as this, the party would be more Anglophilic than others, while still advocating complete independence, and would class itself as being very pro-business and fiscally conservative. The party see Mitteleuropa as an excellent opportunity to benefit from foreign investment, and hold an ambivalent view on religion and the Church. Seeing all political and social issues in Ireland through the prism of economics, the party believe wealth creation and thorough modernisation should be the key goal of any government.§!\n"
 IRE_social_conservative_party_long: "$IRE_social_conservative_party_short$\n§gAn Saorstát Críostúil, meaning \"the Christian Republic\", reflects the values of this party headed by Éamon de Valera. The party traces its origins to a split-off from Sinn Féin after the 1922 election, when Cathal Brugha would leave the party over disagreements regarding social policy and Collins' role in government, creating \"Cumann an tSaorstáit\", or \"Society of the Republic\". After an underwhelming term in office following a surprise win in the 1926 election, the party has regrouped with former Príomh Aire de Valera taking up leadership, along with changing the party's name and pushing it to his specific vision.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil draw quite a number of their views directly from Catholic doctrine, and would favour more development of Ireland's existing agrarianism over further industrialisation. The party would find themselves firmly more conservative than Sinn Féin on social matters, but is to Sinn Féin's left economically, as they are more willing to consider certain \"social justice\"-based policies advocated by the Church. Breaking with his predecessor, de Valera is somewhat hostile to the Mitteleuropa project and aspires to keep Ireland in splendid isolation away from the horrors of the coming storms.§!\n"
 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text: "Sinn Féin\n§gSinn Féin, meaning \"Ourselves\", have undoubtedly been the pre-eminent party in Ireland since the mid-1910s. The oldest party in the state, they were founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, originally promoting a Dual Monarchy between Great Britain and Ireland akin to Austria-Hungary, proposing that Irish MPs abstain from Westminster and instead meet in Dublin. Although they remained abstentionist, this policy radically shifted to republicanism following the party being erroneously credited with the Easter Rising of 1916. Griffith remained working with the party, handed over party leadership to surviving 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, and the party steamrolled into power in the 1918 Home Rule Election, foregoing any British authority and instead forming Dáil Éireann in Dublin.\n\nAfter the small split in the party following the War of Independence and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, it has been the current party's vision that has moulded the young republic. Seen as the party of the Irish middle class, they have formed the pillars of Law, Order, Religious Pluralism and International Trade. While being just to the right of centre on political and economic matters, Sinn Féin are considered to be socially liberal and somewhat cosmopolitan in the Irish context."

He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

By radiating outwards from our capital in [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], we should have this portion completed speedily."
 IRE_northern_ireland_electric_desc: "[IRE_loc_ulster] is a province of two halves; low-lying and densely populated east [GetStateName_119] is already mostly electrified, it was simply a matter of connecting built up towns along a flat plain. West [GetStateName_119], however, is the complete opposite; what land that is not half way up a mountain is found in wet, marshy bogs. Although pre-existing railways will give us a basic blueprint for how to link up the main settlements, covering the hinterlands of the province will still be time consuming."
 IRE_munster_electric_desc: "Although [GetStateName_135] boasts two of Ireland's most significant cities, [GetVictoryPointName_7394] and [GetVictoryPointName_6313], this belies the fact that much of [GetStateName_135] is intensely rural, and this makes electrification of the province a challenge. Additionally, the southwest of the province is a geographical labyrinth of mountainous peninsulas that would challenge even hardy goats to climb, much less humans."
 IRE_connacht_electric_desc: "The electrification of Connacht is a dramatic challenge. To begin with, large sections of the province are covered in soft, damp marshes housing bogs doing their best to prevent any infrastructure ever taking root. Although not as mountainous as [GetStateName_135], Connacht too has its mountain ranges and they too are significant obstacles. Finally, Connacht is both Ireland's least populated and most rural province, with its population the most dispersed of the island, with a huge percentage living in villages and hamlets strung out along distant and far-flung farm roads. With the railroads few, and with many roads no more than muddy dirt paths, there is little existing infrastructure that we can build on top of, and thus in many cases we will be starting almost from scratch."

 IRE_election_decisions_desc: "\n\n\n£GFX_IRE_election_cat_texticon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith President Collins calling a new election, the next composition of Dáil Éireann, the national parliament, will soon be in the hands of the Irish people.\nA total of 213 Teachtaí Dála, or TDs, are elected to the Dáil from across all of Ireland's constituencies, using a unique form of proportional representation. With multiple TDs elected from each constituency, a strong party-focused democratic tradition has developed in Ireland, favouring the existence of multiple parties, and ensuring that coalitions and other agreements are often a necessity in the successful formation of a government.\n\nConsidering the banning of the syndicalist parties from elections, the disinterest of the UDP to participate outside of their north-eastern heartlands, and the abstentionism of some members of Aontas Náisiúnta, there are seven different parties competing for a position in government.\n\nConfounding this multi-party system however, is the office of Uachtarán, or President. The Presidency is directly chosen by the people, using a single-transferable-vote, at the same time as the Dáil election. This means that whoever wins the plurality of votes on the initial count, may not end up in charge after all the rounds of counting are completed. While voting for an \"outside candidate\" can never be a wasted vote, unlike some other democracies, the end result is still that the candidates that hold the broadest appeal across the political spectrum are likely to be successful.\n\nAs Ireland is a Presidential Republic, the first role of the President is to attempt to form a government, almost guaranteed to include their own party. Even with multiple parties running for the office, only a few are seen as having a genuine chance of gaining the Presidency itself.\n\nThe parties that have a chance at the Presidency, and to lead the formation of a government, are §gSinn Féin§!, §cAn Saorstát Críostúil§! and the §SLabour Party§!.\n\nThe current likely winner is [IRE_loc_election_plurality_holder]"

 IRE_northern_ireland_federal_desc: "Belfast is the obvious choice for the site of a Federal Assembly in Ulster.

 IRE_munster_federal_desc: "Despite the grumbles of those from Limerick or Waterford, the Federal Assembly in Munster could find no home other than Cork city.

 ireland.24.a.tt: "§YRichard Mulcahy§! becomes the leader of §gSinn Féin§!"
 ireland.32.d.end: "However, in the same manner that Sinn Féin before SC was sunk in the people's eyes by the many concessions made to the Ulster Democratic Party, so too may SC's prospective allies the NDP, possessing a more laissez-faire economic outlook and an Anglophilic streak, being mainly descended from the remnants of the Irish Parliamentary Party, are asking for terms beyond the boundaries of reason. Balancing the desires of his supporters with those of his coalition partners shall prove vital should de Valera wish to avoid the political fate of his most bitter rival."
 ireland.33.d1: "As SC suspected beforehand, the Anglophile leanings of many of the National Development Party's notables have resulted in problems arising as they engaged in talks to form a government. The NDP's leader Seán Lemass, although nowhere near as pro-British as his fellows, is a sternly pragmatic man who unlike SC, spares little sympathy for the plight of Northern Catholics, and regards the resuscitation of the Irish economy as the utmost priority, fearing that alienating loyalists while the effects of Black Monday still continue to take their detrimental toll on the island, might derail any efforts by sparking instability.\n\nHe has insisted that An Saorstát Críostúil must agree to avoid the issue of the Ulster Privileges as a condition for the formation of any coalition between SC and the NDP. Éamon de Valera and his party, on the other hand, are keenly aware that should such the news of such an agreement be leaked in the currently heated political environment, the consequences could be disastrous. As a cunning negotiator and possessing a good personal and working relationship with Lemass, de Valera could try to haggle with Lemass on this matter, pledging to bring Ireland's financial situation under control first, and resolve the issue of the Privileges afterwards, though some of Lemass's colleagues will be less than pleased."
 ireland.34.d2: "With the National Development Party refusing to budge on the Ulster Privileges, Éamon de Valera became reluctantly convinced of the necessity to form a coalition with Aontas Náisiúnta. Eoin O'Duffy, keen to legitimise his party in the mainstream and regain his position as a major figure in the running of the country, eagerly opened negotiations, though neither men particularly trusted the other. In exchange for AN's support, de Valera agreed that a commission on corporatist economic policies would be established and an uncompromising line on Ulster taken, aiming for the ultimate abolition of the privileges.\n\nAlthough both believed membership of Mitteleuropa to have negative ramifications for Irish sovereignty, the two leaders concluded that a slow and steady approach was necessary to loosen ties with the bloc without worsening the financial crisis.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. Hardline nationalists and anti-syndicalists are delighted by the result, hoping that SC and AN will restore order and stability to the nation, as are the Church and faithful voters at seeing a government based on Christian principles, after years of Sinn Féin's quasi-secularism. In Ulster, a visible sense of hope is felt on the streets and in the homes of Catholic areas, concerns about Brugha's previous failure to change the Ulster Privileges dampened by the expectation that AN should ensure \"Dev\" keeps his word. The mood among Protestants is quite the contrary, their seething discontent with Dublin only intensening, to the deep concern of local Gardaí who have already begun to pick up rumours in the wind of radical loyalists beginning to stockpile weapons."
 ireland.1000.d.GER.pataut: "$ireland.1000.d.GER$\n\nThe episode has provoked discord inside the new cabinet as the hesitancy of Kleist, a man long less keen on Weltpolitik, to stoke foreign tensions while Germany faces turmoil at home has clashed with Hassell's support for the Irish in light of not only his anti-syndicalist and Anglophobic views, but also his naval connections, aware of the island's strategic use to Germany. After discussions between the two, it was agreed that Hassell would issue a strongly-worded condemnation of the incident and assure that the "German sword and shield" would stand behind the Irish against syndicalist aggression, so as to deter the British from further transgressions, but that for now the German response would remain diplomatic."

Harry Midgley's NILP, though officially non-sectarian, have become a party primarily of the Protestant working class, and there exist whispers of support for the union of Northern Ireland with the Union of Britain, with rhetoric playing on resentment that the upper class in 1926 \"chose money over Ulster\". The UPL, led by former UUP politician James Hanna McCormick, is stridently anti-Catholic and also regard the UDP as traitors, calling for a policy of abstentionism toward Dáil Éireann. With these changes, the UDP's position as the big-tent representative of the Protestant community is no longer as certain as it once was."

 ireland.2002.d.ENT1: "It can be tough to move on from the past, particularly when it is with those who have wronged you time and time again. And yet, when Ireland decided to reach out to the Entente powers, it attempted to forget their role as the continuation of the British Empire, believing that they had been humbled by their expulsion from their homelands. The government assumed that the British would be eager to acquire a new ally located so close to their homelands, a potential jumping-off point for their envisioned homecomings.\n\n And yet, it appears that the Irish Government had placed too much faith in their ability to work for a better future, as the Entente leadership has seemingly rejected oits efforts to join their alliance. For many in [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is hard not to feel that the British are back to their usual tricks, leaving us out to dry when the going gets rough."
 ireland.2002.d.ENT2: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, and often produces strange bedfellows. Ireland had assumed that considering its rather precarious diplomatic situation, that perhaps it could find some common ground with the Entente, who have spent much of the past two decades in a near-constant state of existential crisis.\n\n Unfortunately it appears that these expectations were not to be long for this world, as the leadership of the Entente have largely dashed any hopes Ireland had of being admitted to their alliance. While their reasons were not given, many cannot help but feel that the Irish general apathy to their expulsions has played a part, which is a claim even the most anglophilic in the country have struggled to deny. Regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that Ireland is on its own."

O'Kelly, also known, from his numerous writings over the years, by his pen name Sceilg. Joining Sinn Féin at their inaugural meeting, helping sway the Irish public to support the defeated rebels in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, and serving as a minister during the War of Independence, [IRE_loc_leader_title] ]O'Kelly has been around for every major Irish event of the century, and watching the Republic he swore his utmost loyalty to fall into corruption following the sellout that was the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it was his ironclad determination to set things right that brought him to the position of authority he now holds.\n\nAlthough a diehard republican, O'Kelly's ideals are not built upon the Godless influences of the French Revolution which he abhors, instead seeking inspiration from classical republicanism and rejecting liberal decadence which favours the selfish needs of the individual at the expense of the common good of the nation and the willingness to sacrifice for it. Though the state he has shaped is nominally democratic, its voting process and corporatist structures are designed to ensure that those elected are not Anglophilic, Jewish or Masonic elements wily enough to hoodwink the masses, but rather men and women of virtue.\n\nWith power consolidated securely in the hands of those who uphold patriotism, Christianity and Ireland's native tongue, Sceilg, as a strong chief akin to the Taoisigh of old at the country's helm, watches vigilantly over the Republic he rescued from those who sought to defile it and the sacrifices made by so many Irish martyrs. Like Daniel O'Connell, who he admired in spite of O'Connell's moderacy, it is certain that O'Kelly will go down in the history books as a great liberator, having fulfilled his lifelong mission to safeguard the isle and its ancient culture from the scourges of liberalism, imperialism and syndicalism alike."

 ireland.3240.d: "For as long as the Gaels have existed, so has migration. The very forefathers of the Gaelic race originated from Iberia, and Hibernian monks carried out their holy endeavours across Europe at the height of Irish civilisation. After the English conquest, many nobles and commoners alike sought refuge on the continent during the 16th and 17th centuries. But it was the so-called famine of the 1840s that did the most damage, halving the Irish population through a combination of mass death and exile, and creating a culture of emigration that would see the island's demographics unremittingly decrease for nearly a century afterwards.\n\nIt would take the improvement of Ireland's economic situation following the nation's entry into Mitteleuropa, and the fall of America and Britain into chaos and revolution respectively to bring this lengthy decline to an end, though some would continue to emigrate to the likes of Canada and Germany. The flow of people leaving the isle would lessen further during Black Monday, due to the global nature of the crisis. However, as a result of dissatisfaction with the integralist government and recovering financial circumstances elsewhere, Ireland now faces another wave of emigrants.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin has denounced such exiles as "péistí", meaning "worms" in English, accusing them of deserting their native land and harbouring syndicalist sympathies. Acting to stem the tide of migrants, the coast guard has been placed on patrol to halt any illegal rafts fleeing the island, and a series of harsh decrees proclaimed requiring Irish citizens to seek approval from the state before departing from the country or returning from abroad. Said permission is only to be granted under stringent conditions, and a severe sentence is to be imposed for unauthorised travel. Through these decisive measures, the authorities hope to prevent a brain drain and ensure that Irish demographics will soon rise back to their pre-famine heights."
 ireland.3900.d1: "With Ireland now a part of the Internationale - and a partner to Britain - an unusual political issue has emerged: Oliver Cromwell. Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."
 ireland.4500.d1: "An interesting proposal has been received this morning from the small nation of Ireland, requesting an economic investment from our nation. With many investors still shaken by the aftermath of Black Monday and the conflict in America, the Irish wish to present Dublin as a new stable home for international business and commerce.\n\nIf this promise of stability holds true, establishing new branches of [Root.GetAdjective] businesses in Ireland's capital may prove to be a mutually beneficial endeavour for all involved parties. It is important however to take into consideration that this upfront cost may not pay off in the long run, and so an informed decision be made as to how we should respond."
 ireland.4550.d.CAN: "Despite some objections regarding historical bad blood, a trade delegation was sent to Canada that managed to secure an investment from the agricultural equipment manufacturer \"Massey-Harris\", and a commitment from them regarding the opening a new office in Dublin. Irish farmers have made use of their equipment in recent years, allowing for a significant expansion in agricultural production.

 irelandflavour.384.d5: "$irelandflavour.384.d.base$\n\nAlthough even John J. O'Kelly cannot deny the debt owed to the United Irishmen, he aims to take Irish republicanism in a direction akin to the classical republican ideal of a mixed government, combining a "monarchy" embodied by a strong presidency, an "aristocracy" of republicans and Gaelic revivalists, and democracy via elections and corporate councils. Through this, Ireland's republicanism shall be harmonised with its culture and faith." # JJOK
 irelandflavour.3810.d.start: "For the anniversary of the retirement of late historian and Senator Alice Stopford Green, a work has been published which examines an area of her interest — Irish nationalism among Protestants and the Anglo-Irish. Given her own background, this subject matter came of no surprise.\n\nThe book argues the irrefutability that since 1798, the Anglo-Irish have played a crucial role in the development of Irish nationalism and republicanism. Anglo-Irish and Protestants never made up more than 15% of the population, and while they would have been overwhelmingly loyalist historically, those who took up the nationalist cause made a disproportionate impact in nationalism as a whole.\n\nFrom the founders of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the movement's leadership has included Protestants, helped by the greater status and education that was afforded to them for centuries. Robert Emmet led his rebellion in 1803, and Charles Stewart Parnell was de facto leader of nationalism in the 1880s. Outside politics, literary greats Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats are also known for their nationalist ideals. The involvement of Protestants in nationalism, it argues, was key in separating the Catholic identity from the Irish one in the late 1700s, a time when they were entwined.\n\nThe book goes as far as contemporary Ireland, focusing on the fringes of politics, such as socialist academic Benjamin Farrington, or integralism proponent Ernest Blythe, and commenting on how the British Revolution may have influenced the popularity of different political groups among this population."
 irelandflavour.3810.d1: "$irelandflavour.3810.d.start$\n\nFor reasonably dry, academic text, the response has been fairly warm, with critics opining that the state's treatment of minorities should be used as a marker of its maturity. Though the Anglo-Irish experience is not quite the same as that of the Ulster-Scots, the government is keen to try and promote the message of ecumenism to those in the north, even if it falls on deaf ears." # Dems
 irelandflavour.3812.d3: "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, especially in recent years as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Even those in government need a break from it all every now and then, especially with their ongoing arduous task of reshaping the political landscape of the country. The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\". Following such high praise and positive reviews, it can only be hoped that this is just the beginning of a new exciting era of Irish theatre."
 irelandflavour.397.d: "For years now the Central Council of the Gaelic Athletics Association have planned to establish a Provincial Council in Britain to administer the games played by the Irish diaspora living in Britain, however stormy relations between our two nations have prevented this from being a possibility.\n\nWith it now being over a year since Ireland's ascension to the Internationale, relations between Britain and Ireland have greatly improved, and over the course of the past few months these plans have finally come to fruition with the establishment of the British Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The creation of the new Provincial Council was announced earlier today by the President of the GAA, making it very clear that the GAA's plans to foster the rebirth of Irish culture in Britain are only just beginning.\n\nAlthough at present only the London and Lancashire county boards make up the newly established British GAA, there is already discussion on how to properly incorporate the more minor county boards of Warwickshire, Yorkshire, and Gloucestershire into the GAA while also establishing proper county boundaries across Britain. Steps have already been taken in Ireland to help foster the growth of the Games in Britain, with this year's annual congress finally abolishing the archaic Rule 21 which banned all members of British security forces from joining the GAA.\n\nWhile Ireland will almost certainly remain the home and core of the Games, many are hopefully within a few decades the British scene will have fully established itself as a key part of the GAA with tefams from both countries competing against each other."
