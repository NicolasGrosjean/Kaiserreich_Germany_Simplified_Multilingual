Moulded by the politics of his father, Connolly at all times holds fast to Syndicalist orthodoxy and his father's idea of the \"triple lock\": One Big Union, One Big Militia, One Big Party. Unconvinced that Irish nationalism can be wrested out of the hands of reactionaries, Connolly believes the road to a workers' republic has to be paved in collaboration with syndicalist allies internationally, not just domestically, a view reinforced by time spent studying in the Commune of France.§!"

Returning home with a far more grounded sense of reality as well as a new sense of Irishness, Cooper became an advocate for Liberalism, Capitalism and Tolerance.\nConsidered a kind and friendly fellow across the spectrum of Irish politics, Cooper has earned a reputation as a builder of bridges and crosser of divides between parties.§!"

 IRE_election_decisions_desc: "\n\n\n£GFX_IRE_election_cat_texticon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith President Collins calling a new election, the next composition of Dáil Éireann, the national parliament, will soon be in the hands of the Irish people.\nA total of 213 Teachtaí Dála, or TDs, are elected to the Dáil from across all of Ireland's constituencies, using a unique form of proportional representation. With multiple TDs elected from each constituency, a strong party-focused democratic tradition has developed in Ireland, favouring the existence of multiple parties, and ensuring that coalitions and other agreements are often a necessity in the successful formation of a government.\n\nConsidering the banning of the syndicalist parties from elections, the disinterest of the UDP to participate outside of their north-eastern heartlands, and the abstentionism of some members of Aontas Náisiúnta, there are seven different parties competing for a position in government.\n\nConfounding this multi-party system however, is the office of Uachtarán, or President. The Presidency is directly chosen by the people, using a single-transferable-vote, at the same time as the Dáil election. This means that whoever wins the plurality of votes on the initial count, may not end up in charge after all the rounds of counting are completed. While voting for an \"outside candidate\" can never be a wasted vote, unlike some other democracies, the end result is still that the candidates that hold the broadest appeal across the political spectrum are likely to be successful.\n\nAs Ireland is a Presidential Republic, the first role of the President is to attempt to form a government, almost guaranteed to include their own party. Even with multiple parties running for the office, only a few are seen as having a genuine chance of gaining the Presidency itself.\n\nThe parties that have a chance at the Presidency, and to lead the formation of a government, are §gSinn Féin§!, §cAn Saorstát Críostúil§! and the §SLabour Party§!.\n\nThe current likely winner is [IRE_loc_election_plurality_holder]"
 ireland.2002.d.ENT1: "It can be tough to move on from the past, particularly when it is with those who have wronged you time and time again. And yet, when Ireland decided to reach out to the Entente powers, it attempted to forget their role as the continuation of the British Empire, believing that they had been humbled by their expulsion from their homelands. The government assumed that the British would be eager to acquire a new ally located so close to their homelands, a potential jumping-off point for their envisioned homecomings.\n\n And yet, it appears that the Irish Government had placed too much faith in their ability to work for a better future, as the Entente leadership has seemingly rejected oits efforts to join their alliance. For many in [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is hard not to feel that the British are back to their usual tricks, leaving us out to dry when the going gets rough."
 ireland.2002.d.ENT2: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, and often produces strange bedfellows. Ireland had assumed that considering its rather precarious diplomatic situation, that perhaps it could find some common ground with the Entente, who have spent much of the past two decades in a near-constant state of existential crisis.\n\n Unfortunately it appears that these expectations were not to be long for this world, as the leadership of the Entente have largely dashed any hopes Ireland had of being admitted to their alliance. While their reasons were not given, many cannot help but feel that the Irish general apathy to their expulsions has played a part, which is a claim even the most anglophilic in the country have struggled to deny. Regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that Ireland is on its own."

 ireland.4550.d.CAN: "Despite some objections regarding historical bad blood, a trade delegation was sent to Canada that managed to secure an investment from the agricultural equipment manufacturer \"Massey-Harris\", and a commitment from them regarding the opening a new office in Dublin. Irish farmers have made use of their equipment in recent years, allowing for a significant expansion in agricultural production. The farmers in particular will be happy with the new Dublin office allowing for quicker customer support, part replacement orders, and new opportunities in employment. "

Needless to say, a large amount of the public feels a great amount of joy at this announcement, uproariously celebrating the demise of the tyrannical empire which caused the island and its people so much suffering for generation after generation, laying to waste its ancient culture and language, though others more sympathetic to the Entente's cause are concerned regarding what the repercussions of this apparent collapse will mean for the international world order and Ireland's future in it.\n\nLoyalists, on the other hand, have by contrast been plunged into a state of abject horror and despair, as the hopes many desperately clung onto that the British would one day return and bring Ulster back under their control have been at last decisively shattered. Struggling to cope with what for them is a terrible turn of events, loyalism has found itself at a loss on how to respond.

Ironically, in a twist few would have expected a mere decade ago, many feel deep alarm at this announcement of their erstwhile master-turned-ally's collapse in spite of the suffering the empire once caused the island and its people, though those opposed to the goverment's pro-Entente stance on the other hand are naturally more than happy to celebrate the demise of Ireland's former oppressors, who did so much damage to its ancient culture and language.\n\nIn the north, loyalists have been struck with dismay and horror as the monarchy they have upheld and vowed to defend, even at the price of cooperating with their age-old Irish Catholic foes, appears in mortal danger. For the majority of moderate loyalism, this has only reinforced their determination to stand alongside [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in opposition to their mutual enemies despite their misgivings.
