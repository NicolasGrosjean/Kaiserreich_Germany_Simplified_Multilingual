 mitteleuropa_open_button_desc_enabled: "The Central European Customs Union, also known as §HMitteleuropa§!, is the economic alliance unifying the German bloc, an uncomfortable compromise between German supremacy and progressive vision of pan-European cooperation. Its internal structure is complicated, but its key institutions are the §HMitteleuropa Conference§!, a summit of delegates from all member states that takes place every six months, and the §HMitteleuropa Commission§!, a bureaucratic authority controlled by the member states whose §HPresidency§! is reelected by each Conference.\n\nIn the Mitteleuropa §HTab§!, you are able to see the President country, all member states, and a list of possible §HAgendas§! to propose for the next Conference. Each member state is able to invest §HPolitical Power§! to promote their Agenda of choice or try to be elected the next §HMitteleuropa President§!. At the end of the cycle and the beginning of the next Conference, the President will select and activate §Htwo§! Agendas from the three most supported Agendas - as well as their own Agenda, if they selected any. Then, a new President election will take place and the cycle continues.\n\nAs the founder and most powerful country, §H[GER.GetNameWithFlag]§! has access to a focus tree to unlock new Agenda types and initiate Mitteleuropa reform - as well as §Hbend the conference to their favor...§!\n\nThe Presidency of Mitteleuropa is held by §Y[MIT.GetNameWithFlag]§!\nThe next meeting of the Mitteleuropa Commission will happen in roughly §Y[GER.GetMitteleuropaNextElection]§!."

It is up to the Chairman of the Mitteleuropean Commission, who is currently from [MIT.GetNameDef], to select which of the many proposals will be implemented by the bureaucratic authorities.\n\nSince we chose to abstain from the voting process, we automatically recieve the benefits of the winning agenda proposal."

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1001.d: "The Central European Customs Union, more commonly known as Mitteleuropa, has returned back to action. Once again, summits of the foreign affairs ministers of the organisation are being held, each one with the intention of coordinating the economies of the alliance and facilitating easier flow of goods. Over time, Mitteleuropa expanded to several official and unofficial fields of activity - and the interests of the member states may take it to aid in one field or another.\n\nOf course, certain intellectuals and politicians envision a bit more, and dream of the chance to reform the organisation and create something new... A German economic hegemony? A fulfillment of pan-European dreams? Time will tell."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of an Enforcement Directorate of Mitteleuropa. This directorate will be tasked with observing the implementation of Regulations in all member states, and will have the ability to reprimand states as well as establish sanctions on member states which do not fulfill the imposed Regulations. This will increase German control over Mitteleuropa."
