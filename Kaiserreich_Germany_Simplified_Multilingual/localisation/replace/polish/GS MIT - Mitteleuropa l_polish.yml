 mitteleuropa_open_button_desc_enabled: "The Central European Customs Union, also known as §HMitteleuropa§!, is the economic alliance unifying the German bloc, an uncomfortable compromise between German supremacy and progressive vision of pan-European cooperation. Its internal structure is complicated, but its key institutions are the §HMitteleuropa Conference§!, a summit of delegates from all member states that takes place every six months, and the §HMitteleuropa Commission§!, a bureaucratic authority controlled by the member states whose §HPresidency§! is reelected by each Conference.\n\nIn the Mitteleuropa §HTab§!, you are able to see the President country, all member states, and a list of possible §HAgendas§! to propose for the next Conference. Each member state is able to invest §HPolitical Power§! to promote their Agenda of choice or try to be elected the next §HMitteleuropa President§!. At the end of the cycle and the beginning of the next Conference, the President will select and activate §Htwo§! Agendas from the three most supported Agendas - as well as their own Agenda, if they selected any. Then, a new President election will take place and the cycle continues.\n\nAs the founder and most powerful country, §H[GER.GetNameWithFlag]§! has access to a focus tree to unlock new Agenda types and initiate Mitteleuropa reform - as well as §Hbend the conference to their favor...§!\n\nThe Presidency of Mitteleuropa is held by §Y[MIT.GetNameWithFlag]§!\nThe next meeting of the Mitteleuropa Commission will happen in roughly §Y[GER.GetMitteleuropaNextElection]§!."
 MIT_budget_quota_idea_desc: "All voting in the Conference is now weighted according to the country's contribution to the budget of Mitteleuropa, drastically in favor of Germany as this is their project first and foremost. §YMakes Mitteleuropa mechanics much cheaper for the sitting President.§!"

 germany_mitteleuropa_events.d.no_agenda_supported: "Delegates from all Mitteleuropa states gather in Berlin for biannual discussion as well as negotiations on the direction of the bloc's activities. Though hundreds of different issues will be discussed, only those which received the attention of enough member states will receive the time of day they need. It is up to the Chairman of the Mitteleuropean Commission, who is currently from [MIT.GetNameDef], to select which of the many proposals will be implemented by the bureaucratic authorities.\n\nSince we chose to abstain from the voting process, we automatically recieve the benefits of the winning agenda proposal."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.abstained: "Great."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of an Enforcement Directorate of Mitteleuropa. This directorate will be tasked with observing the implementation of Regulations in all member states, and will have the ability to reprimand states as well as establish sanctions on member states which do not fulfill the imposed Regulations. This will increase German control over Mitteleuropa."
