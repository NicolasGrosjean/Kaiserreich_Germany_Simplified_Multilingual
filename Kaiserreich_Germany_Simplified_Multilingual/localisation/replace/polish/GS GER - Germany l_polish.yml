 germany.8.d_krw: "It had been anticipated ever since late last year, but it finally arrived thanks to the Black Monday market crash. Not long after that day in February, Reichskanzler Herbert von Dirksen announced his resignation, offering little comments to the press or to the members of the Reichstag. Though a competent diplomat, Dirksen's composure and character of a vain, pompous aristocrat left him isolated in high politics, and he never managed to shake off the veneer of being a royal appointment, less legitimate than partisan chancellors in the post-March German Empire. His Vice-Chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, refused to seek the Kaiser's appointment as the next Reichskanzler. After the Black Monday crisis, the office became a poisoned chalice.\n\nSeeing little initiative from the parties in the Reichstag, Wilhelm II appointed the current Minister-President of Prussia, Siegfried von Roedern, as the new Reichskanzler. An elder civil servant with years of experience in the Federal and Prussian governments alike, he currently heads a nonpartisan government of the centre and right in Prussia, staffed with right-wing politicians and nonpartisan professionals. Though his government is not planning to survive the April election, it has a lot on his plate regardless."

The move has generally received negative reactions from the Prussian legislature, and has been decried on the left as a threatening expansion of Schleicher's power - however, most of the political establishment accepted the decision without much fanfare. In his opening speech before the Prussian House of Representatives, Schleicher stated that he intends to maintain the spirit of cooperation fostered by his predecessor, Siegfried von Roedern, and his first action will be to establish and expand work relief programmes across the Kingdom."

As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own.

He was already a second lieutenant when the Weltkrieg broke out, where he served as a communications officer in charge of signals intelligence of the 4th Army. Guderian fought at Verdun, in Italy and was finally stationed in Poland at the end of the war.\n\nHad he not met the famous Weltkrieg tank commander, Ernst Volckheim, Guderian might have continued along the traditional Prussian path. However, Volckheim's controversial ideas about the primacy of armoured units inspired Guderian greatly. During the 1920s he became a prolific scholar of armoured warfare and followed closely the emerging French theories of the \"guerre de mouvement.\" However, his stubborn insistence on the new doctrine and piercing sarcasm did not make him very popular among the German General Staff, and in 1927 he was \"promoted\" to act as military attaché to King August IV, and given the responsibility of overseeing and training the Polnische Wehrmacht into a modern fighting force.\n\nDespite being de facto exiled to Poland, and any career advancement, Guderian decided to put his theories into practice with the Polish army. He has gathered a clique of like-minded officers such as Oswald Lutz and even some Poles, like Władysław Anders, and most importantly, Guderian managed to convince the Polish government to support his vision of the war of the future - no doubt seeing a small, elite army as an option that would in the long term prove to be cheaper and more popular than mass conscription. By 1936, Guderian has worked tirelessly with his Panzer divisions, leading the modernisation of the Polish army and their doctrine for any future war.§!"

Moving from a position as adjutant in the Bavarian Foot Artillery Brigade to various divisional and corps staff appointments, Kesselring would continue to observe and expand on his knowledge on the use of aircraft in support of ground forces.\n\nMoving to the infantry branch following the conclusion of the war, Kesselring toyed with the idea of transferring to the nascent Luftstreitkräfte but decided to remain with the army for the better opportunities for advancement in the Bavarian Army.

They formed a lifelong friendship and supported each other in their careers from then on out.\n\nHammerstein-Equord served as a staff officer during the Weltkrieg and continued rising in rank after its conclusion. In the divided Deutsches Heer, he was a supporter of von Seeckt's reforms, which would transform the army into a smaller, yet more professional force that would adapt all of the newest principles of war. Schleicher tactically backed this faction, at least for a while, and after he became the Prussian Minister of War, he pushed his lifelong friend into the highest office of the OHL, consolidating his power over the Army and giving him a powerful base for his political ambitions.

He found socialism through unionisation - working to unionise sales assistants in his city, he ended up involved with the Free Trade Unions and joined the SPD itself. By 1905, he had amassed enough influence with his activism that August Bebel pushed him forward as a party secretary - however, the unions, which believed that Müller was too left-wing, blocked his candidacy.\n\nBy the Weltkrieg, Müller had moderated - he sharply criticised Rosa Luxemburg and positioned himself in the party's centre, between the revolutionary left and the right-wing revisionists. Still, for a time, he lost influence to Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann. Again, he answered with a pivot - this time a bit more to the left, preying onto the frustration with the party's cooperation with the Brockdorff cabinet and passivity, he advocated a more aggressive approach that could neuter the March Coalition and allow the formation of a centre-left democratic government. In 1930, he was finally elected as one of SPD's co-chairmen - the party's uncompromising position towards the Dirksen Cabinet that helped sabotage it in the leadup to the 1936 election is the result of his agitation.\n\nMuch like his father, a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, Müller is irreligious.§!"

 germany.14.d: "Reorganisation is taking place among the German parties, as long suspected collaboration between the conservative agrarian DkP and the far-right DVLP has been officially announced by their chairmen, Kuno von Westarp and Ulrich von Hassell. This agreement entails raising joint candidates in key constituencies and a common chancellor nominee for the upcoming elections. In an official statement, both parties have described the alliance as a necessary measure to "defend the German banner from ceaseless partisanship and societal decline", reflected in the alliance name - \"Schwarz-Weiß-Rot\" (Black-White-Red), the colours of the Imperial flag.\n\nThe left has already criticised the duplicity of this alliance of convenience. Since 1923, the DkP has been involved in every government without interruption and epitomises the partisan establishment that the DVLP claims to be fighting against. Earlier right-wing cooperation had failed to materialise throughout the 20s and 30s due to leadership disagreements and the overlapping voting blocs of the two parties, as well as the DkP's convenient position within the March Coalition. The altered political climate post-Black Monday, however, has led to a change of mind - old hurdles fade away as closer links between the old conservative establishment and the radical nationalist opposition are being forged..."
 germany.17.d: "Alfred Hugenberg, 2nd Chairman of the DVLP, is among the Fatherland Party's most prominent faces, below only Ulrich von Hassell. Though his position is largely symbolic, a token compromise made to the party's reactionary old guard after Hassell's rise to power in 1929, he commands a notable clique within the DVLP and keeps it alive through his considerable wealth. As one of Germany's most powerful businessmen and press barons, Hugenberg is in charge of the gigantic "Hugenberg Group", a media empire controlling newspapers, publishers and advertising agencies across the Empire - their papers sell hundreds of thousands of copies and hold considerable sway on public opinion. Of course, their articles are biased towards Hugenberg's preferred beliefs, rabid anti-Socialism and anti-Semitism.\n\nThe 1936 electoral campaign has given the DVLP hope that they can position themselves as the leader of an all-right coalition in the Reichstag after the election, so the party's central committee has requested a mass propaganda drive from the 2nd Chairman. An aggressive promotion campaign for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten and Der Tag, expansion of the Telegraphen-Union news agency and promotion of their articles to more and more newspapers, perhaps even a few movie deals - all could serve to form the desired image of the old Party of Tirpitz out there.\n\nWhere should the resources of the campaign be concentrated, however? Focusing on the Illustrierte Nachtausgabe and cutting deals with urban newspapers will improve the DVLP's chances to win the middle class in the cities and cut down social democratic growth - on the other hand, the Telegraphen-Union has fostered good relations with independent rural news outlets, and investing more in this relationship will aid the conservative cause in the Prussian countryside."
 germany.18.d: "It had been anticipated ever since the February market crash, but it has now become clear - the breakdown of the German economy has greatly bolstered the far left of the political spectrum. Socialist propaganda has swept up thousands of workers across the nation, offering an easy answer to the confusion of many workers thrown out of their job because of factors they could not control. It is because the illusion of prosperity that the bourgeoisie, the Junkers and the Kaiser at the top maintained has shattered - the final hour of international capitalism is at hand, so make sure to stand in line and hoist the red flag!\n\nThe German far left parties are generally small and fractured, and though they are not banned, they are only somewhat tolerated by the political establishment. After years of splits and reunions, the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) has garnered most of the socialist share. Though supportive of French-style syndicalism, the KAPD holds some reservations, believing that trade unions in Germany have become hopelessly reformist and so the revolutionary vanguard must be factory councils of workers - hence, \"council communism\". The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) is also prominent, distinguished by the fact that they participate in electoral politics, unlike their cousins.\n\nIn spite of bad blood between the numerous factions of the far left, they find the strength to cooperate from time to time - and today is one of those cases. The KAPD, KPD and their aligned trade unions are planning a mass demonstration in Berlin on International Workers' Day, May 1st, and expect to be joined by similar events in the Rhineland and Saxony."
 germany.19.d: "In response to growing militancy of the German workers and citing previous sporadic cases of violence during the electoral campaign, the police force of Berlin issued a ban on open-air political gatherings in the city during May 1, aiming to prevent the planned May Day demonstrations. This did not deter far left activists, however, and even emboldened some — these restrictions appeared to affirm the official party line of the KAPD that capitalism has entered its Third Period, and so will respond to workers' movements with more and more draconian force.\n\nDemonstrations took place across the city, rough tallies of the numbers showed that threats of police violence balanced out the growing socialist membership, meaning that the size of the KAPD and KPD gatherings were hardly larger than normal. Still, Berlin Police responded with force, sending out flying squads and attacking with truncheons wherever demonstrations were reported. Even the lawful conventions, such as SPD and liberal trade union assemblies, were mistaken for socialist protests and attacked. Street combat broke out in the socialist-dominated Wedding district, but it was one-sided and only served to escalate police response — live rounds were fired upon KAPD demonstrations and over thirty people were killed by the end of the day. Around 200 were injured and 1200 were arrested by the police.\n\nDistribution of Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung was curtailed in the aftermath to suppress the casualty numbers, but the message spread across the nation nonetheless, and further inflamed friction between the government and the labour movement. The events were largely viewed positively by the right wing of the Reichstag, while the liberals and SPD were more divided — in particular, while the SPD newspaper Vorwärts produced a scathing piece stating that the KAPD was \"seeking to intentionally sacrifice supporters' lives\", the Social Democratic delegation in the Reichstag officially protested the actions of Berlin policemen and demanded an investigation. Their demands fell on deaf ears, however, while tensions continue to rise."
 germany.20.d: "The economic crisis has sparked discussions across various ideological circles and associations — the traditional consensus among German economists has failed, or, at least, is no longer being trusted by the average worker and politician. Witnessing millions being thrown to the streets and dozens of banks collapsing overnight, parties, associations and trade unions now look towards the government for potential salvation. That state intervention may help drive up demand and reinvigorate the economy during the financial cycle has been contemplated during the interwar period and these ideas have only gained more traction since Black Monday.\n\nThe journal of the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), Die Arbeit, has opened discussion on what they have named \"active economic policy\" after the publication of a political economic programme by the trade unionists Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade. This plan, titled the "Tarnow-Baade Plan" after its creators, posits the creation of massive public works which could employ up to one million people across the Empire, as well as tighter banking controls which would allow an extensive inflationary policy. According to Tarnow and Baade, work creation and fiscal inflation will provide relief for the poor and drive up demand, solving the downfall.\n\nThough the ADGB is closely allied with the SPD, the party has actually distanced itself from the Tarnow-Baade Plan. Otto Wels and Rudolf Hilferding have both criticised the ADGB for its direct intervention in politics, which should be delegated solely to the party, and for Tarnow and Baade's intentions to "play doctor at the bedside of capitalism". Undeterred, the trade unionists have been making waves across the press nonetheless, and earned the surprising endorsement of the Prussian Minister of War, Kurt von Schleicher, who described work creation as \"the only way out of today's plights\"."
 germany.24.desc: "Times could definitely be better for the Zentrum Party, the main representation of Catholic interests in German parliamentary politics. After many years of aimless leadership under the moderate Rhenish wing, two mediocre election results in 1931 and 1936, and the collapse of several government cabinets with Zentrum participation over the course of the last few years, Zentrum chairman Theodor von Guérard has officially announced his retreat from the leadership of his party. A party conference, the first in many years, has been called, and politically interested observers are convinced that it will be one of fierce party-internal confrontations. Throughout the last decade, new factions within Germany's oldest political party have sprung up like mushrooms and are willing to seize power and lead the party onto a new political course, but the question will be, what political wing will come out on top?"

 germany.36.d: "The right have now consolidated their hold over the government of Germany, and the chance of the incumbent cabinet falling due to pressure from the Reichstag appears increasingly narrow. As article after article is printed on grand plans to dismantle the already fairly weak parliamentary system in Germany in order to replace it with decades of right-wing dominance, social democrats grow increasingly uneasy. This concern is especially held among the young generation of the SPD - who, unlike their predecessors, have a far different image of politics. While the party elders entered leadership during the Anti-Socialist Laws of the late 19th century and thus swore to always seek the most legal path to power to avoid a second period of repression, the politicians born in the 1890s or later never experienced this and thus are far more aggressive, though not necessarily more ideologically radical.\n\nWithin chapters of the SPD, trade union meetings and socialist study groups, tense discussion is taking place on whether the Social Democrats should take to the streets to fight for the defence of democracy - and it seems a large bulk of the party's mass membership are swayed by this rhetoric. Leading members of the SPD's youth wing, such as Kurt Schumacher and Theodor Haubach, as well as the long forgotten yet existing radical left wing of the party, which includes such people as Max Seydewitz and Kurt Rosenfeld, have been recognised as the leaders of this move. Though the party central committee still expects to just wait out a short-lived period of right wing rule, not everyone believes that democracy will simply defend itself."
 germany.38.d: "The leadership of the democratic opposition has been under hard attack from the far left lately - publications by KAPD and KPD aligned papers have highly criticised their position, claiming that they lack the militancy necessary to defend Germany from the emergence of yet another reactionary dictatorship. Social Democratic and liberal leaders, fearing a threat to their leadership of the democratic movement, have responded in kind, attacking the socialists and syndicalists for their ceaseless call for division among the anti-reactionary front. All in all, it has been a very good week for us - the democrats have weakened their positions significantly."
 germany.40.d: "Our government policy has come under fire in the Reichstag — which Social Democratic deputies have been using as a tribune ever since the election of 1936.

While reporting on this incident was muted in right-wing press, Social Democratic papers gave it front pages and significant coverage."
 germany.49.d: "The beginning of the Second Weltkrieg caught German society unprepared - and not only because Germany was not an instigator of the conflict this time. Since 1934, it has been occupied with internal conflicts partisan squabbles, all of which were far more relevant to the politicians and the common people than distant worries of another military conflict. Russian aggression in the East and syndicalist rearmament in the West were concerning, for sure, but the expectation was that the undefeated Imperial Germany Army will make quick work of the aggressors.\n\nAs a result, the German Empire enters the war unprepared, and rapid mobilisation policies will need to be passed in order to hasten our rise from slumber.

Already, numerous protests actions, sometimes even violent ones, have been noticed springing up throughout the Ruhr..."
 gerschl.20.t: "KAPD Calls for Armed Struggle in the Ruhr"
 gerschl.20.d: "The beginning of the general strike in the Ruhr has emboldened far left organisations across Germany — on the other hand, they have welcomed the beginning of the strike with reservation. In the view of the syndicalists and radical socialists in the KAPD, KPD and other far-left parties, the last thing this mass movement should become is a mere battle for workers' rights — that is hopeless concessionism to the bourgeoisie upper class, which will merely make the revolution more distant rather than make it draw nearer.\n\nNewspapers such as Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung and Die Rote Fahne have begun calling for the Rhenish workers to establish dual rule in the Ruhr, replacing the state's organs with workers' councils which can manage the day to day affairs, provide leadership to the workers, and eventually replace the state entirely. The Marxist philosopher and one of the leading figures of the Berlin Tendency of the KAPD, Karl Korsch, called for the formation of \"Proletarian Hundreds\" to defend the brewing workers' rising from any attempts at suppression.\n\nThe Preußische Geheimpolizei has curtailed the distribution of this revolutionary material and has begun investigating both the KPD and KAPD for their state-threatening activity."
 gerschl.26.d: "Under the leadership of Carl Severing, one of the main figures in the right wing of the SPD and a powerful figure in the Bielefeld SPD, a summit has been held between the main representatives of the government and the strikers. Regional representatives of political parties ranging from Zentrum to the KAPD, local trade union leaders, municipal dignitaries and representatives of the political executive committees of the strikers took seat, as well as a minister from Prussia and the central government each for observation and consultation.\n\nThe two priorities of the conference, as described by Severing, was to negotiate an armistice between the arming workers and the central government in a way that would not make either side resort to violence - and, second, a comprehensive settlement that would allow the workers to return to their jobs safely. The demands of the Ruhr workers have risen well beyond the wage increases which sparked the Ruhrkampf, however, and the government may not be interested in fulfilling their demands, either."
 gerschl.26.b: "Isolate the KAPD and KPD, but make concessions to establishment unions."
 gerschl.27.d: "The Bielefeld Summit is over, and has shown some promise. Moderate trade unionists among the Ruhr strikers are willing to compromise on some of their political programme in order to achieve material gains for the workers - and while the KAPD-influenced radicals are obviously not going to concede, cooperation with the moderates may leave them marginalised and thus turn the strike harmless. Of course, a lot more work is necessary to moderate the radicalism of the strike and contain its spread, and even the strikers who were receptive to compromise have not returned to work thus far, hoping to get even more gains by pressuring their factory owners a bit more."
 gerschl.28.d: "Our attempt to negotiate with the Ruhr strikes has been met with failure. Even the moderate wing, more concerned with material gains than political objectives, chose to not waver from their programme and kept the trade unionist movement united, and the KAPD-influenced radicals were active as ever agitating for no compromises with the government. We will have to seek alternate approaches if we want to get the workers to return back to their factories."
 gerschl.32.d: "The worst we could have expected has happened in the Ruhr - while making a speech in Essen, the Reichskanzler was fired upon from the crowd, causing mass panic and a riot which the city police forces only restrained after two hours of fighting and several lives. Schleicher survived the attack, but was wounded in the arm and had to be immediately hospitalised for an operation.\n\nAfter interrogations of captured rioters, the assailant has been identified as Erich Mielke - a member of the KAPD, trained by its self defence units in espionage, handling weapons and terrorism. The assassination attempt was planned by Mielke's unit in advance. Unfortunately, the failed assassin vanished in the crowd and escaped the grasp of justice, but the news coming from Essen have emboldened the government.

Criticism on the national level was equally fierce — numerous parties, including the SPD, LVP, and even the progressive elements of Zentrum lodged their criticism, especially as neither the Luxembourger government nor the major steel producers have even considered negotiation with the strikers.\n\nFrustrated with the opposition, Bech chose to put an end to this rhetoric once and for all, by announcing a referendum on the Maulkuerfgesetz — believing that he represents the \"silent minority\" outside the main working-class towns, he expects to win the referendum with a large margin and legitimise his authoritarian move."
 gerschl.40.d: "The tensions and conflict in Germany have finally spilled over - and a terrifying spark has just been lit in the small, industrialised Duchy of Brunswick. During an absence by Duke Ernst August and his wife, Princess Viktoria Louise of Prussia, for a solemn celebration of the sovereign's birthday at the family's winter residence of Cumberland Castle in Upper Austria, violence and fighting broke out on the streets on the capital. The small statelet has been engulfed by the general strike for months, and yet the Minister-President, Werner Küchenthal, refused to make any concessions to the socialist movement. In spite of these vast historic class tensions and a past attempt at revolution in 1918, the government and political system remained conservative, refusing to implement universal suffrage and clutching onto a system of plural voting to contain the growth of Social Democrats and the far left.\n\nOver time, however, secret armament of worker self-defence groups in Brunswick and defections from the small Brunswickian garrison turned the tide in favour of the strikers, and yet another police raid at midnight in November led to a sudden violent response from the workers. The police and garrison were defeated in street clashes, barricades were erected and the revolutionaries occupied several public buildings, including the police headquarters, railway station and the prisons. Küchenthal's government fled from the Duchy, and the leader of the Brunswicker KAPD, Rudolf Lindau, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Brunswick off the steps of Brunswick Palace."

 gerschl.57.d: "Worrisome developments are taking place in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nThe passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz has already resulted in the banning of the KAPD, KPD and other far left parties on Luxembourger soil, but this is not enough for the entrenched regime of the Party of the Right. The Maulkuerfgesetz was endorsed by the \"Fundamentalist\" faction of the party, championed by priest and party ideologue Jean-Baptiste Esch, who believe that the Party of the Right should form a single party state on the principles of Political Catholicism and the collaboration of the social classes. It is known that President of the Council Joseph Bech is sympathetic to their ideas as well, and so are many in the Party — after all, they live on the border with the Commune, and few in Germany fear French revolutionary belligerence more than they do.\n\nStrengthened and emboldened by the passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz, the Fundamentalists have increased their hold upon the party and pushed through several additional reforms in Luxembourg — all parties besides the Party of the Right have been severely restricted, a government controlled Christian trade union was established and all independent unions were banned, and freedom of the press has been restricted. Luxembourg is becoming an authoritarian regime — as the Frankfurter Zeitung described, it is \"a dictatorial ulcer in the heart of Germany\"."
 gerswr.4.d: "Now that the black-white-red front is in power, the Zentrum Party has an important key role to play. While the Catholics will not directly join the coalition in order to preserve party unity, their party's stance towards the new government will decide how easy it will be for the rightists to efficiently govern the country in the future. A more left-leaning Zentrum could severely hamper their ambitious visions, while a more right-leaning Zentrum is much more likely to tolerate them, thereby handing them out a carte blanche as long as Catholic and federal interests aren't harmed.\n\nQuite fortunately for Kleist, Hassell, Westarp and co, the second case applies. The newly-elected conservative-federalist leadership of the Zentrum Party around Schäffer welcomes the appointment of the Kleist government, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition. Schäffer himself has lauded the nationalists' united efforts against the Schleicher administration to prevent pseudo-revolutionary experiments and military-imposed centralisation attempts, and expressed his hope that the new government will take a tougher line than previous governments in defending both Germany's domestic order and the European order in the name of international peacekeeping."

The newly-elected progressive leadership of the Zentrum Party around Carl Ulitzka has condemned the appointment of the new far-right coalition, and, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition, has decided to adopt a resolute attitude of no tolerance towards it. With a strong and united front ranging from the far-left to the Catholics forming in the Reichstag, the future of the Kleist government remains uncertain. A rocky road lies ahead."

Within the Christian Trade Unions, fears have become loud that certain reactionary circles within the DkP and DVLP could work towards a reversal of many hard-won labour laws. Stegerwald himself tolerates our government for now, but will keep a close eye on our future labour policy programme - the wrong decisions could cost us the silent support of one of the Empire's most powerful mass organisations."

Staffed by many right-wingers and moderates who will hopefully outbalance the harmful influence of Stegerwald's Christian trade unions within the board, the party chairs should hopefully keep their mouths shut as long as we keep the basic democratic-federal framework intact, and they might even be swayed with certain corporatist concessions, ideas which have long gained appeal even in the moderate establishment."
 gerswr.17.d: "In the months following Hugenberg's appointment as Secretary of the Economy, his vast press empire has gone into overdrive - newspaper articles flood the nation, lauding the politician's financial and economic acumen. Hugenberg is heralded as the "Economic Saviour," portrayed as the linchpin for Germany's economic resurgence, with his indispensability to the government being emphasised at every turn. Similar rhetoric flies from the entrepreneur's allies in the Reichstag, which has received a handful of new members thanks to this propaganda drive.\n\nTo the national revolutionary leadership of the DVLP, and Hassell in particular, this initiative poses a threat more than a boon. The relentless focus of the Hugenberg press on their owner's persona, with only cursory mentions of his role within the DVLP, raises concerns about his motives; it is hard to ignore the fact that he is building up his personal reputation. Some even float suspicions that the Economic Secretariat is merely his first stepping stone to fully controlling the government's actions with his influence - after all, the State Secretary of the Economy wields substantial power within the cabinet..."
 gerswr.32.d: "The time in power has not been kind to the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot coalition - it has lost enough deputies that it no longer holds a majority in the Reichstag. Though this is not necessarily a death sentence to a government, especially if it is equipped with an Enabling Act to strengthen the position of the Reichskanzler, it does mean that passing any law will become a struggle - especially annual budgets, which may not be possible without backing from Zentrum, the far right or the left.\n\nThe recent era of Reichskanzler Dirksen is a sharp reminder of what a cabinet without majority support in the Reichstag may degenerate to. Needless to say, this is sparking panic among cabinet secretaries and parliament notables, and any option is being considered. A prolonged minority government? A nonpartisan cabinet, coordinated with the Kaiser? Integrating Zentrum into the government?"

 gerswr.92.d: "Decadence is has permeated not only the Hohenzollerns for decades, but also a majority of the aristocracy, right down to the most impoverished landed gentry. How can the Second Estate still assume their divine responsibility of acting as idols for the common man? It's no wonder that today's youth are seen as particularly spoiled, they lack people they can look up to! The veneration of role models begins at the village level; the lord of the local manor is more likely to serve as an identification figure for the simple farmhand than the Kaiser in far-away Berlin. Kleist is certain that there is a need for pioneers who lead the way to bring about a change of mind among the nobility.\n\nLuckily, such a pioneer happens to live not too far from Gut Schmenzin: Kleist's aunt Ruth von Kleist-Retzow of the neighbouring Klein Krössin estate, elderly matriarch of the Kleist family and Pomerania's most famous female Junker. Throughout her life, Ruth, who shares most of the religious-idealist ideas of her Schmenzin relative, has written a plethora of guidebooks about the nobility's obligations, the most famous being \"The Responsibility of Landed Property in This Social Crisis\". Here, she stresses that large-scale land ownership brings not only privileges, but also responsibilities.\n\nAs the \"little king\" of his small community, the Junker must care for the well-being of his subordinates, for example by providing funds to increase local healthcare and accommodation standards for his agricultural workers and farmhands; to quote Ruth, \"A landowner who affords a car, but not a community nurse, is not worthy of the estate that God has given to him!\"\n\nOur recent reforms should relieve the Junkers and detach them slightly from the capitalist framework while preventing rural exodus to the cities more resolutely. Only without profit-related considerations in mind, the Junker class will be able to assume its ancient responsibilities again. The writings of Ruth von Kleist-Retzow should be mandatory literature in every noble household - in the long term, this will not only strengthen the ties between Junkers and rural workers, but will also turn the Prussian countryside into a reliable bulwark of stalwart tradition."
 gerswr.99.t: "Death of Kuno von Westarp"
 gerswr.99.d: "Today, Germany mourns the passing of Kuno von Westarp, long-time leader of the Conservative Party, who peacefully died at the age of 81. Though retaining the title of First Chairman until his death, Westarp assumed a subordinate role ever since the chairman elections of 1939, dedicating himself mostly to scholarly pursuits, most recently a comprehensive volume on conservative politics during the Wilhelmine Era.\n\nThe political legacy of the old-conservative titan is legendary. Defamed by his opponents as an archetypical Junker who adopted a pragmatic disguise after the introduction of the March Constitution to preserve the Conservatives' standing, Westarp was in fact a quite complex figure. Born into a modest family of rural gentry, without vast estates to his name, Westarp ascended the political ladder through sheer diligence and merit within the civil service, avoiding traditional avenues of power, wealth, or familial connections. Thus, unlike his genuine Junker colleagues, his convictions stemmed not from agrarian lobby interests but from an intrinsic loyalty to the monarchy and the Prussian civil service.\n\nAlthough Westarp's allegiance to such old-fashioned ideals meant that he was never able to detach himself from the 19th century's Bismarckian mindset, his guidance ensured the Conservative Party's survival at pivotal moments in recent history. Under the banner of "Applied Conservatism," he revitalised the party, bringing it to the forefront of politics again and dominating the landscape throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Initially sceptical of the Black-White-Red coalition, Westarp eventually found his role within the "new" Germany that has arisen throughout the last decade - primarily as an internal opponent to the national revolutionary ideas of Hassell and his associates.\n\nRegardless of one's personal opinions on Westarp, his enormous mark on conservative ideology during the 1910s, 20s, and 30s is undeniable. But while influential in his time, his way of thinking is now a relic of the past. A new era of conservatism has begun, and only the future will show what will become of Westarp's political legacy."
 gerswr.101.d: "The government's announcement of its new planned authoritarian policies were not taken lightly by Zentrum. The government may be dominated by the two Conservative parties, but it is Zentrum which gives it the necessary backing for a majority in the Reichstag. This means that we have to pay attention to their demands, as well as their red lines. \n\nZentrum's leadership has announced that they will recommend their deputies to vote against the planned measures, and will consider leaving the coalition should they go ahead regardless. Not all of Zentrum's deputies will follow through - the federalist conservatives in Bavaria, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg and the circle around the Westphalian landowner Franz von Papen will likely stay with us regardless - but who knows if that will be enough?"
 gerswr.103.d: "The government's new policy, improving relations with the states and supporting ones with friendly conservative governments, has raised Zentrum's attention. Powerful on the state level, it leads several state governments, including all three of the southern states - Baden, Wurttemberg and Bavaria. These states would, understandably, love federal help for various local development projects. Pork barrel spending, as the Americans would call it.\n\nThe Zentrum deputies demand their governments to be given preference for federal support to state governments, and are especially vehement on this - should we refuse them, it is possible that they will destroy the coalition with the intention of reforming a more friendly center-right coalition."
 gerspd.391.t: "Formation of the All-Democratic Front"
 gerspd.391.d: "After a brief respite, the Reichstag has once again become a battleground between democratic forces and reactionary elements seeking to subvert the will of the people. With the threat of an authoritarian coup looming ever larger, Chancellor Müller has called for a united front of all democratic parties, trade unions, and civil society organizations. This "All-Democratic Front" is not merely a coalition of convenience, but a pledge to defend the Reich's fragile democracy against those who would see it undone. Liberals, social democrats, and progressive activists have for the most part agreed—however uneasily—to put aside their differences in the face of this renewed threat."
 gerspd.391.a: "Now this is solidarity!"
 gerflavour.13.d: "After a reign of over 53 years, Prince Friedrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont has peacefully passed away today at age 81. Despite his lacking charisma and barely existent political legacy, Friedrich achieved what many German monarchs have dreamt of: he is now officially the longest-reigning sovereign in the 75 years-long history of the German Empire, surpassing even the legendary Wilhelm II by just a few weeks, something that probably makes the \"Eternal Kaiser\" turn in his grave.\n\nThe great insignificance of Prince Friedrich can be attributed not only to the fact that Waldeck is one of Germany's smallest and least populous constituent states, but also to Waldeck's extreme dependency on Prussia. Due to a controversial treaty signed in 1867 as the principality was not able to cover the yearly matricular contributions every member state has to pay, the prince was turned into an irrelevant figurehead, while the internal administration was taken over by the Prussians from nearby Kassel and Hanover. On several occasions, outright dissolution of Waldeck-Pyrmont was on the table, in parts because activists in Bad Pyrmont, who have not much in common with their rulers in Arolsen, called for a unification with the Province of Hanover, but these plans always came to nothing.\n\nIt will be the duty of Friedrich's son, Prince Josias of Waldeck-Pyrmont, to steer the tiny principality through a new era."
 gerflavour.31.d: "Plans for a reform to the Imperial Constitution have been drafted ever since the formation of the Demokratische Union coalition in 1936 — and now, with the end of the Second Weltkrieg, they may finally be put into place. Though the Kaiser had little to do with it (and is in fact opposed to many of the proposals for the constitutional reform), the term \"Wilhelmine Constitution\" has already begun floating throughout the press and civil society. After all, it would be the crowning achievement of the Wilhelmine Era - it may have begun with the Personal Regiment of the Kaiser and the tyranny of the OHL during the First Weltkrieg, but it ended with a victory for the democratic process and became synonymous with the parliamentarisation of the Empire.\n\nThe end result has surprised even radical social democrats in the left wing of the SPD. It turns out that an successful negotiation process allowed the SPD to bend all of its coalition partners to accept pretty much all of its demands - the government system has been fully parliamentarised, the powers of the reactionary states have been curtailed, and progressive reforms such as women's suffrage have been passed. Germany has, finally, entered the ranks of modern civilised states."

 gerflavour.96.d: "With the leadership of the SPD seemingly impotently unable to muster any resistance to the conservative regime beyond protest in the Reichstag, a handful of Social Democratic activists have taken matters to their own hands. A so-called 'Democratic Self-Defense' (Demokratische Notwehr) was established by left-wing veterans in Magdeburg, attracting activists from the SPD Young Turks, Socialist Party members and even radicalized trade unionists from local chapters of FAUD. It was led by Member of the Reichstag Karl Höltermann, himself a Weltkrieg veteran and journalist.\n\nThe organization's intention was to serve as the paramilitary arm of the 'all-German democratic movement', supposedly transcending party boundaries, although it was social democratic in practice. However, it was short-lived. The Prussian Secret Police infiltrated the organisation from the beginning, and the reactionary government in Prussia ordered it to be banned on the grounds of 'sheltering Syndicalist activists'. Faced with the full power of the state, the Self-Defense could not defend itself and surrendered without a fight. Six hundred arrests followed, including that of Höltermann and several other notable Magdeburg SPD leaders.\n\nWhat little motivation there was among the German social democrats to resist with force has been crushed. Their passivity and decades-long desperation to integrate into the political establishment have made them completely impotent when the call for resistance came."

Both of them are not members of the SPD, but rather of the Polish Socialist Party of the Prussian Partition, which formed an electoral agreement with the SPD during the 1936 election campaign and won two constituencies in Upper Silesia.\n\nThe beginning of republican revolution in Poland has reignited the PPS zp's leaders' nationalist sympathies and alienated them from the government completely. After loud, furious speeches in the Reichstag where the two deputies demanded immediate political and economic independence for Poland, a withdrawal of the 'occupation forces' and 'to take the Kaiser's son back to Germany and allow the Polish people to decide their own fate', they joined the opposition. The Prussian Secret Police has already begun investigations into their possible connections with the Polish nationalist underground.\n\nUnfortunate, but perhaps we should have known this would happen, after all, the PPS split from the SPD once... twice... thrice..."
 gerflavour.104.d1: "The conference has voted for Max Seydewitz, Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. A surprising choice, it is a clear example of the growing strength of the left wing of the SPD - he was most strongly promoted by Secretary of Education Otto Grotewohl as well as the left-leaning Socialist Youth, though he also garnered surprising support among the veteran theoreticians of the SPD. The party's revisionists and rightists are nervous, but have accepted the result for now.\n\nSeydewitz's acceptance speech makes it clear that he intends to promote the SPD's Marxist, socialist roots, even in the post-syndicalist age, and will focus on organising the youth and the rank-and-file members of the Party. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d2: "The conference has voted for Wilhelm Sollmann, Member of the Reichstag and Under-Secretary of the Interior, as Haubach's co-Chairman. Considered to be a member of the right wing of the party, he has been described by a few as a 'neo-Staatspolitiker', a pragmatist in the same vein as Otto Braun and Carl Severing, and also has a nationalist streak, such as his support for pan-Germanism. Liberal newspapers claim that Sollmann's victory, especially promoted by Braun, Severing and the other revisionists, happened in response to the SPD's very troubling time in the Demokratische Union government, including a significant marginalisation of the left.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Sollmann focused on the necessity of cooperation between the Social Democrats and the other pragmatic, pro-democratic forces in the country - the SPD needs to continue displaying its pragmatic credentials and show that it remains capable of leading the country. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d3: "The conference has voted for Adolf Schärf, formerly member of the parliament of Austria, later Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. With Austria's recent integration into the German Empire, the Austrian SDAP has integrated itself into the SPD, quickly becoming one of the party's largest branches - and they actively demanded an Austrian co-chairman ever since their integration. It appears that their demands have been met.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Schärf focused on the need for a 'full unification of Germany' spiritually and culturally, while also repeated his firm alignment to the Social Democratic party program. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d4: "The conference has voted for Fritz Baade, trade union official and Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. In the Social Democratic Party, he is most famous for being the co-author of the Tarnow-Baade Plan, which, in spite of initial reservations, was adopted by the SPD during their time in government and led to an impressive economic recovery. Also known as the party's foremost expert on agriculture, Baade was crucial in formulating the party's response to the German agrarian crisis.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Baade put most emphasis on the claim that the SPD is a party for the workers first and foremost - and then criticised the party's 'intellectual core' for spending too much time 'theorizing' instead of helping the working class. Needless to say, his memories of Rudolf Hilferding's scepticism towards the Tarnow-Baade Plan are behind his divisive claims. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 gerflavour.104.d5: "The conference has voted for Fritz Naphtali as Haubach's co-Chairman. Known as Rudolf Hilferding's protege, Naphtali is one of the party's most influential economic theorists and a promoter of 'economic democracy', as well as a notable critic of the Tarnow-Baade Plan. His victory was easy to predict - among the party centre, he is perhaps the most prominent leader who is not one foot in the grave.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Naphtali focused on the future of the German economy, claiming that he will work on a new theory of economic democracy and a new party program which more adequately represents the conditions and needs of postwar Germany. He lodged criticism both towards the ADGB and their 'nationalist influences' as well as the 'intransigence' of the party left. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
