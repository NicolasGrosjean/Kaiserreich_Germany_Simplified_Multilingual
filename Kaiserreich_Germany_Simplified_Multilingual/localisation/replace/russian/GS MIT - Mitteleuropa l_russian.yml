 germany_mitteleuropa_events.d.no_agenda_supported: "Delegates from all Mitteleuropa states gather in Berlin for biannual discussion as well as negotiations on the direction of the bloc's activities. Though hundreds of different issues will be discussed, only those which received the attention of enough member states will receive the time of day they need. It is up to the Chairman of the Mitteleuropean Commission, who is currently from [MIT.GetNameDef], to select which of the many proposals will be implemented by the bureaucratic authorities.\n\nSince we chose to abstain from the voting process, we automatically recieve the benefits of the winning agenda proposal."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.abstained: "Great."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1001.d: "The Central European Customs Union, more commonly known as Mitteleuropa, has returned back to action. Once again, summits of the foreign affairs ministers of the organisation are being held, each one with the intention of coordinating the economies of the alliance and facilitating easier flow of goods. Over time, Mitteleuropa expanded to several official and unofficial fields of activity - and the interests of the member states may take it to aid in one field or another.\n\nOf course, certain intellectuals and politicians envision a bit more, and dream of the chance to reform the organisation and create something new... A German economic hegemony? A fulfillment of pan-European dreams? Time will tell."
 germany_mitteleuropa_events.1006.d: "The Mitteleuropa Conference has approved the creation of an Enforcement Directorate of Mitteleuropa. This directorate will be tasked with observing the implementation of Regulations in all member states, and will have the ability to reprimand states as well as establish sanctions on member states which do not fulfill the imposed Regulations. This will increase German control over Mitteleuropa."
