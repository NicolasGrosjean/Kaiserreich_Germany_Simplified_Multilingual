Not long after that day in February, Reichskanzler Herbert von Dirksen announced his resignation, offering little comments to the press or to the members of the Reichstag. Though a competent diplomat, Dirksen's composure and character of a vain, pompous aristocrat left him isolated in high politics, and he never managed to shake off the veneer of being a royal appointment, less legitimate than partisan chancellors in the post-March German Empire. His Vice-Chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, refused to seek the Kaiser's appointment as the next Reichskanzler. After the Black Monday crisis, the office became a poisoned chalice.\n\nSeeing little initiative from the parties in the Reichstag, Wilhelm II appointed the current Minister-President of Prussia, Siegfried von Roedern, as the new Reichskanzler. An elder civil servant with years of experience in the Federal and Prussian governments alike, he currently heads a nonpartisan government of the centre and right in Prussia, staffed with right-wing politicians and nonpartisan professionals.

The move has generally received negative reactions from the Prussian legislature, and has been decried on the left as a threatening expansion of Schleicher's power - however, most of the political establishment accepted the decision without much fanfare. In his opening speech before the Prussian House of Representatives, Schleicher stated that he intends to maintain the spirit of cooperation fostered by his predecessor, Siegfried von Roedern, and his first action will be to establish and expand work relief programmes across the Kingdom."

As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own.

He was already a second lieutenant when the Weltkrieg broke out, where he served as a communications officer in charge of signals intelligence of the 4th Army. Guderian fought at Verdun, in Italy and was finally stationed in Poland at the end of the war.\n\nHad he not met the famous Weltkrieg tank commander, Ernst Volckheim, Guderian might have continued along the traditional Prussian path. However, Volckheim's controversial ideas about the primacy of armoured units inspired Guderian greatly. During the 1920s he became a prolific scholar of armoured warfare and followed closely the emerging French theories of the \"guerre de mouvement.\" However, his stubborn insistence on the new doctrine and piercing sarcasm did not make him very popular among the German General Staff, and in 1927 he was \"promoted\" to act as military attaché to King August IV, and given the responsibility of overseeing and training the Polnische Wehrmacht into a modern fighting force.\n\nDespite being de facto exiled to Poland, and any career advancement, Guderian decided to put his theories into practice with the Polish army. He has gathered a clique of like-minded officers such as Oswald Lutz and even some Poles, like Władysław Anders, and most importantly, Guderian managed to convince the Polish government to support his vision of the war of the future - no doubt seeing a small, elite army as an option that would in the long term prove to be cheaper and more popular than mass conscription.

Moving from a position as adjutant in the Bavarian Foot Artillery Brigade to various divisional and corps staff appointments, Kesselring would continue to observe and expand on his knowledge on the use of aircraft in support of ground forces.\n\nMoving to the infantry branch following the conclusion of the war, Kesselring toyed with the idea of transferring to the nascent Luftstreitkräfte but decided to remain with the army for the better opportunities for advancement in the Bavarian Army.

In the divided Deutsches Heer, he was a supporter of von Seeckt's reforms, which would transform the army into a smaller, yet more professional force that would adapt all of the newest principles of war.

By 1905, he had amassed enough influence with his activism that August Bebel pushed him forward as a party secretary - however, the unions, which believed that Müller was too left-wing, blocked his candidacy.\n\nBy the Weltkrieg, Müller had moderated - he sharply criticised Rosa Luxemburg and positioned himself in the party's centre, between the revolutionary left and the right-wing revisionists. Still, for a time, he lost influence to Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann. Again, he answered with a pivot - this time a bit more to the left, preying onto the frustration with the party's cooperation with the Brockdorff cabinet and passivity, he advocated a more aggressive approach that could neuter the March Coalition and allow the formation of a centre-left democratic government. In 1930, he was finally elected as one of SPD's co-chairmen - the party's uncompromising position towards the Dirksen Cabinet that helped sabotage it in the leadup to the 1936 election is the result of his agitation.\n\nMuch like his father, a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, Müller is irreligious.§!"

Stadtler, a protege of Straßburg history professor and right-wing ideologue Martin Spahn, became a leading member of the latter's Alsace-based far-right Christian-Social Homeland Party (CSHP) during the 20s, which slowly developed into a regional branch of the DVLP in Alsace after the rise of Ulrich von Hassell. Appointed into the local government in Alsace-Lorraine after the 1935 Landtag elections as part of the Joseph Brom cabinet, Stadler holds surprisingly many contacts, from big business to major politicians and newspapers, and is highly ambitious - but he is a loyal follower of the First Chairman's national revolutionary, anti-democratic line.§!"

 germany.18.d: "It had been anticipated ever since the February market crash, but it has now become clear - the breakdown of the German economy has greatly bolstered the far left of the political spectrum. Socialist propaganda has swept up thousands of workers across the nation, offering an easy answer to the confusion of many workers thrown out of their job because of factors they could not control. It is because the illusion of prosperity that the bourgeoisie, the Junkers and the Kaiser at the top maintained has shattered - the final hour of international capitalism is at hand, so make sure to stand in line and hoist the red flag!\n\nThe German far left parties are generally small and fractured, and though they are not banned, they are only somewhat tolerated by the political establishment. After years of splits and reunions, the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) has garnered most of the socialist share. Though supportive of French-style syndicalism, the KAPD holds some reservations, believing that trade unions in Germany have become hopelessly reformist and so the revolutionary vanguard must be factory councils of workers - hence, \"council communism\". The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) is also prominent, distinguished by the fact that they participate in electoral politics, unlike their cousins.\n\nIn spite of bad blood between the numerous factions of the far left, they find the strength to cooperate from time to time - and today is one of those cases. The KAPD, KPD and their aligned trade unions are planning a mass demonstration in Berlin on International Workers' Day, May 1st, and expect to be joined by similar events in the Rhineland and Saxony."
 germany.19.d: "In response to growing militancy of the German workers and citing previous sporadic cases of violence during the electoral campaign, the police force of Berlin issued a ban on open-air political gatherings in the city during May 1, aiming to prevent the planned May Day demonstrations. This did not deter far left activists, however, and even emboldened some — these restrictions appeared to affirm the official party line of the KAPD that capitalism has entered its Third Period, and so will respond to workers' movements with more and more draconian force.\n\nDemonstrations took place across the city, rough tallies of the numbers showed that threats of police violence balanced out the growing socialist membership, meaning that the size of the KAPD and KPD gatherings were hardly larger than normal. Still, Berlin Police responded with force, sending out flying squads and attacking with truncheons wherever demonstrations were reported. Even the lawful conventions, such as SPD and liberal trade union assemblies, were mistaken for socialist protests and attacked. Street combat broke out in the socialist-dominated Wedding district, but it was one-sided and only served to escalate police response — live rounds were fired upon KAPD demonstrations and over thirty people were killed by the end of the day. Around 200 were injured and 1200 were arrested by the police.\n\nDistribution of Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung was curtailed in the aftermath to suppress the casualty numbers, but the message spread across the nation nonetheless, and further inflamed friction between the government and the labour movement. The events were largely viewed positively by the right wing of the Reichstag, while the liberals and SPD were more divided — in particular, while the SPD newspaper Vorwärts produced a scathing piece stating that the KAPD was \"seeking to intentionally sacrifice supporters' lives\", the Social Democratic delegation in the Reichstag officially protested the actions of Berlin policemen and demanded an investigation. Their demands fell on deaf ears, however, while tensions continue to rise."
 germany.24.desc: "Times could definitely be better for the Zentrum Party, the main representation of Catholic interests in German parliamentary politics. After many years of aimless leadership under the moderate Rhenish wing, two mediocre election results in 1931 and 1936, and the collapse of several government cabinets with Zentrum participation over the course of the last few years, Zentrum chairman Theodor von Guérard has officially announced his retreat from the leadership of his party. A party conference, the first in many years, has been called, and politically interested observers are convinced that it will be one of fierce party-internal confrontations. Throughout the last decade, new factions within Germany's oldest political party have sprung up like mushrooms and are willing to seize power and lead the party onto a new political course, but the question will be, what political wing will come out on top?"

 germany.38.d: "The leadership of the democratic opposition has been under hard attack from the far left lately - publications by KAPD and KPD aligned papers have highly criticised their position, claiming that they lack the militancy necessary to defend Germany from the emergence of yet another reactionary dictatorship. Social Democratic and liberal leaders, fearing a threat to their leadership of the democratic movement, have responded in kind, attacking the socialists and syndicalists for their ceaseless call for division among the anti-reactionary front. All in all, it has been a very good week for us - the democrats have weakened their positions significantly."
 germany.40.d: "Our government policy has come under fire in the Reichstag — which Social Democratic deputies have been using as a tribune ever since the election of 1936. During debates on laws proposed by the cabinet, several of their MPs organised a protest, declaring our reforms to be a slap in the face of democracy and the \"achievements of the March Reforms to the Constitution\".\n\nIn addition, the agitators tried to appeal to the emotions of the deputies watching, asking them to vote against all government pilicies and join them in agitation to defend democratic principles. While reporting on this incident was muted in right-wing press, Social Democratic papers gave it front pages and significant coverage."
 gerschl.16.d: "When there's smoke, there's fire - and when there's strikes, there's syndicalist sabotage. The Preußische Geheimpolizei reports that large numbers of provocateurs have appeared in the Ruhr region in the days after the beginning of general strike in the region. They are well supplied and funded, and are agitating for our workers to stand firm against both the resisting businesses and the reactionary government. Some appear on secret police lists of suspected syndicalist activists, their contacts with the Third Internationale, the KAPD and KPD, or even the radical Bund der Kommunisten, are known.\n\nAs much as we and the press might denounce these agitators as traitors in our midst, there is no denying that they are effective. Already, numerous protests actions, sometimes even violent ones, have been noticed springing up throughout the Ruhr..."
 gerschl.20.t: "KAPD Calls for Armed Struggle in the Ruhr"
 gerschl.20.d: "The beginning of the general strike in the Ruhr has emboldened far left organisations across Germany — on the other hand, they have welcomed the beginning of the strike with reservation. In the view of the syndicalists and radical socialists in the KAPD, KPD and other far-left parties, the last thing this mass movement should become is a mere battle for workers' rights — that is hopeless concessionism to the bourgeoisie upper class, which will merely make the revolution more distant rather than make it draw nearer.\n\nNewspapers such as Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung and Die Rote Fahne have begun calling for the Rhenish workers to establish dual rule in the Ruhr, replacing the state's organs with workers' councils which can manage the day to day affairs, provide leadership to the workers, and eventually replace the state entirely. The Marxist philosopher and one of the leading figures of the Berlin Tendency of the KAPD, Karl Korsch, called for the formation of \"Proletarian Hundreds\" to defend the brewing workers' rising from any attempts at suppression.\n\nThe Preußische Geheimpolizei has curtailed the distribution of this revolutionary material and has begun investigating both the KPD and KAPD for their state-threatening activity."
 gerschl.26.d: "Under the leadership of Carl Severing, one of the main figures in the right wing of the SPD and a powerful figure in the Bielefeld SPD, a summit has been held between the main representatives of the government and the strikers. Regional representatives of political parties ranging from Zentrum to the KAPD, local trade union leaders, municipal dignitaries and representatives of the political executive committees of the strikers took seat, as well as a minister from Prussia and the central government each for observation and consultation.\n\nThe two priorities of the conference, as described by Severing, was to negotiate an armistice between the arming workers and the central government in a way that would not make either side resort to violence - and, second, a comprehensive settlement that would allow the workers to return to their jobs safely. The demands of the Ruhr workers have risen well beyond the wage increases which sparked the Ruhrkampf, however, and the government may not be interested in fulfilling their demands, either."
 gerschl.26.b: "Isolate the KAPD and KPD, but make concessions to establishment unions."
 gerschl.27.d: "The Bielefeld Summit is over, and has shown some promise. Moderate trade unionists among the Ruhr strikers are willing to compromise on some of their political programme in order to achieve material gains for the workers - and while the KAPD-influenced radicals are obviously not going to concede, cooperation with the moderates may leave them marginalised and thus turn the strike harmless. Of course, a lot more work is necessary to moderate the radicalism of the strike and contain its spread, and even the strikers who were receptive to compromise have not returned to work thus far, hoping to get even more gains by pressuring their factory owners a bit more."
 gerschl.28.d: "Our attempt to negotiate with the Ruhr strikes has been met with failure. Even the moderate wing, more concerned with material gains than political objectives, chose to not waver from their programme and kept the trade unionist movement united, and the KAPD-influenced radicals were active as ever agitating for no compromises with the government. We will have to seek alternate approaches if we want to get the workers to return back to their factories."
 gerschl.32.d: "The worst we could have expected has happened in the Ruhr - while making a speech in Essen, the Reichskanzler was fired upon from the crowd, causing mass panic and a riot which the city police forces only restrained after two hours of fighting and several lives. Schleicher survived the attack, but was wounded in the arm and had to be immediately hospitalised for an operation.\n\nAfter interrogations of captured rioters, the assailant has been identified as Erich Mielke - a member of the KAPD, trained by its self defence units in espionage, handling weapons and terrorism. The assassination attempt was planned by Mielke's unit in advance. Unfortunately, the failed assassin vanished in the crowd and escaped the grasp of justice, but the news coming from Essen have emboldened the government. The public demands action against these terrorists, and they shall provide."
 gerschl.40.d: "The tensions and conflict in Germany have finally spilled over - and a terrifying spark has just been lit in the small, industrialised Duchy of Brunswick. During an absence by Duke Ernst August and his wife, Princess Viktoria Louise of Prussia, for a solemn celebration of the sovereign's birthday at the family's winter residence of Cumberland Castle in Upper Austria, violence and fighting broke out on the streets on the capital. The small statelet has been engulfed by the general strike for months, and yet the Minister-President, Werner Küchenthal, refused to make any concessions to the socialist movement. In spite of these vast historic class tensions and a past attempt at revolution in 1918, the government and political system remained conservative, refusing to implement universal suffrage and clutching onto a system of plural voting to contain the growth of Social Democrats and the far left.\n\nOver time, however, secret armament of worker self-defence groups in Brunswick and defections from the small Brunswickian garrison turned the tide in favour of the strikers, and yet another police raid at midnight in November led to a sudden violent response from the workers. The police and garrison were defeated in street clashes, barricades were erected and the revolutionaries occupied several public buildings, including the police headquarters, railway station and the prisons. Küchenthal's government fled from the Duchy, and the leader of the Brunswicker KAPD, Rudolf Lindau, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Brunswick off the steps of Brunswick Palace."
 gerschl.57.d: "Worrisome developments are taking place in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nThe passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz has already resulted in the banning of the KAPD, KPD and other far left parties on Luxembourger soil, but this is not enough for the entrenched regime of the Party of the Right. The Maulkuerfgesetz was endorsed by the \"Fundamentalist\" faction of the party, championed by priest and party ideologue Jean-Baptiste Esch, who believe that the Party of the Right should form a single party state on the principles of Political Catholicism and the collaboration of the social classes. It is known that President of the Council Joseph Bech is sympathetic to their ideas as well, and so are many in the Party — after all, they live on the border with the Commune, and few in Germany fear French revolutionary belligerence more than they do.\n\nStrengthened and emboldened by the passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz, the Fundamentalists have increased their hold upon the party and pushed through several additional reforms in Luxembourg — all parties besides the Party of the Right have been severely restricted, a government controlled Christian trade union was established and all independent unions were banned, and freedom of the press has been restricted. Luxembourg is becoming an authoritarian regime — as the Frankfurter Zeitung described, it is \"a dictatorial ulcer in the heart of Germany\"."
 gerflavour.13.d: "After a reign of over 53 years, Prince Friedrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont has peacefully passed away today at age 81. Despite his lacking charisma and barely existent political legacy, Friedrich achieved what many German monarchs have dreamt of: he is now officially the longest-reigning sovereign in the 75 years-long history of the German Empire, surpassing even the legendary Wilhelm II by just a few weeks, something that probably makes the \"Eternal Kaiser\" turn in his grave.\n\nThe great insignificance of Prince Friedrich can be attributed not only to the fact that Waldeck is one of Germany's smallest and least populous constituent states, but also to Waldeck's extreme dependency on Prussia. Due to a controversial treaty signed in 1867 as the principality was not able to cover the yearly matricular contributions every member state has to pay, the prince was turned into an irrelevant figurehead, while the internal administration was taken over by the Prussians from nearby Kassel and Hanover. On several occasions, outright dissolution of Waldeck-Pyrmont was on the table, in parts because activists in Bad Pyrmont, who have not much in common with their rulers in Arolsen, called for a unification with the Province of Hanover, but these plans always came to nothing.\n\nIt will be the duty of Friedrich's son, Prince Josias of Waldeck-Pyrmont, to steer the tiny principality through a new era."
 geregg.3.d: "The unthinkable has happened. The Imperial German Army has been defeated on the battlefield and is being driven deeper and deeper into the country, sacrificing millions of our citizens to the occupation of the syndicalist bloc and the Russian alliance. The mood in the country is pessimistic. The democratisation of the Empire since 1936 has also led to a reasonable, though modest growth to Germany's radical socialist movements - which have been emboldened even more by the Army's defeats at the front. For some, it seems certain that the only way Germany can survive is if it surrenders, and the only way it can surrender is if it topples the reactionary monarchist regime.\n\nSo, today, the blow to the German monarchy has been struck. Spontaneous revolts, instigated by the KAPD and KPD with participation from the National-Communists, begun throughout Berlin and the other major cities, the first workers' councils have been set up, intending to wrestle power from the state and pave the way to a syndicalist revolution. Naturally, law enforcement and reserve divisions responded with force. Street clashes have begun throughout Berlin.\n\nHowever, the Kaiser did not stay to get overthrown or, worse, lynched by the furious crowds. The heart and soul of the Empire, the symbol of its rise to world supremacy, allegedly boarded a submarine with his family in order to escape to the colonies, or to a neutral country in South America - whatever his fate may be, he clearly did not have faith in Germany's ability to win the war.\n\nSo, is it over?"
