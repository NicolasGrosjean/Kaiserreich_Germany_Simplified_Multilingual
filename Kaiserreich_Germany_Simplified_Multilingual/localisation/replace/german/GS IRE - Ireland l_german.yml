 ireland_events.1006.d: "There was surpise and consternation at this week's cabinet meeting, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs notified the government of a most unusal offer from the Union of Britain; that they return to us the corpse of Sir Roger Casement, the Anglo-Irish anti-imperialist campaigner and hero of the independence era. Against his own wishes, Casement was buried in an English prison following his execution in 1916 for treason, after he ran guns from Germany to Ireland for the Easter Rising.\n\nAn immediate and rowdy debate ensued amongst the cabinet about whether this is some kind of ploy by the British, or a genuine attempt at soothing relations. The British, for their part, have presented this as an olive branch that will coincide with the 21st anniversary of the Easter Rising.\n\nWhile the opportunity to give Casement a proper burial is extremely appealing, some members of the cabinet have noted this deal would require at least some kind of glad-handing of the Union of Britain, if not an outright public acknowledgement of them as a \"fellow Republic\".\n\nIt would be difficult for the government to publically sing the Union of Britain's praises in return for Casement, but on the other hand, refusing the offer might be tantamount to political suicide, as the opposition and public would never claim to understand it."
 ireland_events.1009.d1: "$ireland_events.1009.d.start$ Although the majority of loyalists had grudgingly accepted joining the hated Irish Republic as an alternative to syndicalism, the burning of Irish, British and German flags atop these bonfires took off during the interwar period, as an avenue to express passive resistance.\n\nThough the month was always a nervous affair due to the ever-present ethno-religious hostilities, the rise of AN, the NLCL and the UPL made the build up to this year's twelfth particularly tense, as June and early July were marked by an increase in reports of sectarian violence perpetrated by Blueshirts and UPL supporters. These mounting tensions exploded on the Twelfth itself, as a confrontation broke out while an Orange Order march passed through a Catholic area, escalating into a riot. Gardaí were ineffective at quelling the rioting, with allegations spreading of local Gardaí siding with rioters from their own communities, and by the end of the day several people were dead and many homes destroyed.\n\n"
 ireland_events.1009.d1.otherdem: "Worse yet, as news spread from Ulster, a series of incidents were reported of angered Blueshirts attacking and intimidating southern Protestants in retaliation, but Gardaí were quickly mobilised to restore order, and those threatened also received aid from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, opposing sectarianism and never missing a chance to brawl with their \"integralist\" enemies. With all eyes now focused north, the government has found itself in an even more tricky position as public pressure for reform has become all the more intense."
 ireland_events.1009.d1.scan: "As news spread from Ulster, incidents were reported of angered Blueshirts attacking and threatening southern Protestants in retaliation. While the Príomh Aire's influence ensured that the Gardaí attempted to sweep such crimes under the rug, the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, denouncing sectarianism, stepped in to protect the threatened Protestants where the government failed, their clashes with their azure-shirted foes drawing public attention to the attacks and criticism of O'Duffy's continued ties to the supposedly disbanded National Guard."
 ireland_events.1009.d2: "$ireland_events.1009.d.start$ While the build up to the Twelfth had always been a tense affair, it was particularly true for this year, as the Blueshirt coup was greeted with much alarm by Ulster loyalists. These tensions erupted in Belfast today as not only did loyalists set off multiple bombs, but several parades devolved into riots as they were blocked by Blueshirts upon attempting to march through Catholic areas. Though the riots were put down with an iron fist, the brutality used only served to alienate Ulster Protestants against the government.\n\nDue to this growing resistance not only from loyalists but also in the south, from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army and pro-democratic elements, O'Duffy and Ó Cuinneagáin have met with the cabinet to discuss how to approach the situation. From the former general's perspective, the issue is domestic, the result of a lack of discipline among the Irish people and demanding the expansion of the Gardai to maintain order, with Protestants to be kept under close watch given their believed inherent disloyalty.\n\nFor Ó Cuinneagáin, the source of the regime's troubles lies abroad with the sinister force of \"Anglo-Syndicalism\" plotting to subvert the Irish nation, and to combat the Red threat a secret police must be established and granted extensive powers to root out via any means, including torture, those traitors willing to take the Saxon shilling. However, such an organisation would be quickly staffed with Blueshirts seeking a more legitimate form of career than their National Guard membership, expanding the integralists' internal influence."
 ireland_events.1017.d: "It has been several months now since \"Belfast calling, Belfast calling\", spoken in a distinct Scottish accent, was first heard on the airwaves, and this has not been without consequence. Radio Free Scotland, even in its earliest stages, was a success — if not too much so.\n\nArmed with a modern, powerful long range transmitter, Radio Free Scotland was able to live up to its promise to reach both Edinburgh and Glasglow from its station in County Down. Although they were aware of the need to thread a reasonable line, the station nonetheless became a vital lifeline for dissenters in Scotland.\n\nIn its wake has been a noticable stream of Scottish exiles secretly crossing the North Channel by boat, organised by Andrew Dewar Gibb in Scotland, and his associate Arthur Donaldson, a department store manager in Dublin, both of the right wing Scottish National Party, and hostile to the Union of Britain. Their presence, and their anti-syndicalist aims, has been welcomed by those of Ulster-Scots descent in the north of the country.\n\nOf the new arrivals, some are here simply to escape their lives in the Union of Britain, some are clearly here to actively organise against it, but there are undoubtedly also some infiltrators who have arrived on our shores with nefarious intent. While the idea of Ireland as a beacon of liberty and safe haven will play well domestically, internationally this is a dangerous game, and the goverment must decide on how they wish to proceed."
 ireland_events.2001.d.INT: "As is to be expected, the Internationale have decided to accept the Irish application to join the working nations of the world, despite the lateness or the circumstances of its occurence.\n\nIt can stand proudly now with its new allies, and work for a better tomorrow."
 ireland_events.2031.d: "When one looks back at the events of the past few decades, few could truly have ever predicted the events that have transpired. From the loss of the first War, the shattering of the Empire, and even now with the victory in the second, it would all seem like outlandish fantasy if your average Briton had heard any of it at the dawn of the Great War. What would likely seem the most outlandish however, would be the events of today, where [IRE_loc_leader_name], the leader of an independent Irish nation, arrived in [GBR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] not as a subject of the crown or an enemy of it but as one of its most important allies.\n\nWhile most of the [IRE_loc_leader_title]'s visit has been purely dedicated to the discussion of logistical and functional concerns that have arisen with the Entente's new place in the world, the symbolic importance of it has not gone unnoticed. Regardless of the centuries of grievances that have built up between the British Crown and the Irish people, the Ireland that [IRE_loc_leader_surname] represents while standing here today is one that is willing to move beyond them. It is an Ireland that was willing to offer a hand to Britain when it had fallen to its lowest point, and it is an Ireland that has subsequently helped pulled Britain back up onto its feet, so that they may now stand together on equal footing.\n\nAnd with such an effort made on their part, it isn't hard for even the most ardent British nationalist to admit that such a future where Ireland and Britain are equal partners is ultimately a desirable one for both nations, and one that they should strive to maintain."
 ireland_events.2512.d: "As per the Constitution, the President is officially apolitical, and cannot make any public statement on the specific outcome of any election. Despite the unprecedent turn of events in the election of the Progressive Labour Party, [Root.GetLeader] has wisely chosen to follow official protocol.\n\nWhile the President's aides privately note the shock of the President at this turn of events, publically [Root.GetLeader] has only spoken of the commitment of the government towards maintaining the parliamentary process and the rule of law.\n\nThe role of the President as a unifying figure has come unto its own, as the supporters of the new regime see the position of the President as even more legitimisation for their government, whereas those who would not have voted for the Progressive Labour Party see the President as a figure more representative of their own views."
 ireland_events.3625.d3: "The President, William O'Brien, has had a difficult few months. From ruling as the elected leader of the country in a time of national crisis, to being overthrown in a military coup, and to being put back in a position of the same name by the Union of Britain, even if an entirely different and lesser role, it has been a time of radical change for a moderate-minded trade unionist. However, rather than struggling to come to terms with what was likely to be his complete political humiliation, O'Brien has used all his powers to ensure that the fate intended for him shall not come to pass.\n\nO'Brien has made himself indispensible to RN Tweedy, and other former entryists into the Progressive Labour Party, who had plotted the Second Revolution from within government. He acts as a link to those outside of the party or even the left, as they are aware of his initially unwilling participation in the British-sponsored regime, and see him as far more favourable to work with than the likes of O'Donnell or Larkin.\n\nIn exchange for opening up these channels of communication and very slowly building acknowledgement of the new regime across the political sphere, O'Brien has begun to ever so subtly influence the ruling cadre's policies. He is eager to ensure that even though Ireland's revolution was built on British arms, it will not remain so that way. And if Ireland is to be socialist, he must do what he can to ensure it is on its own terms."
 ireland_flavour_events.383.d.start: "No matter the political or economic climate in a nation, people will rarely pass up an opportunity to celebrate their heritage, and Ireland is no exception to this. Throughout the country many have made the journey to [IRE_loc_sallins] in [IRE_loc_county] [IRE_loc_kildare] to take part in the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at [IRE_loc_bodenstown] Graveyard that happened on Sunday. Being regarded as the \"Father of Irish Republicanism\" it is no surprise to see a sea of Irish flags waved by the processioners, but the less informed observer may be surprised to see them waving side by side with the tricolour of France.\n\nIf there is one nation that Ireland has been able to continuously count on throughout history to come to its aid, it has been France. United initially by faith, the French sent soldiers to help Irish Catholics in their fight against William of Orange in an attempt to establish an independent Ireland, albeit one still ruled by a British king. It was with the French revolution that France's relationship with Ireland moved beyond faith, and so one hundred and forty years ago they would send brave men to fight alongside Wolfe Tone, irrespective of him being a Protestant rather than a Catholic. This event made the year 1798 become known in Ireland as \"Bliain na bhFrancach\", the \"Year of the French\", and it has permanently defined Ireland's relationship with France to this day."
 ireland_flavour_events.383.d.syndiestart: "This unbreakable bond between the two nations is why these processioners have chosen to wave a version of the tricolour defaced with the symbol of the Communards, Ireland's true allies on the continent.

 ireland_flavour_events.7.d2: "$ireland_flavour_events.7.d.start$ With the capture of Ottawa by the enemy's forces, the House of Windsor has fallen, marking an end to the British Empire after centuries of its existence. Ironically, in a twist few would have expected a mere decade ago, many feel deep alarm at this announcement of their erstwhile master-turned-ally's collapse in spite of the suffering the empire once caused the island and its people, though those opposed to the goverment's pro-Entente stance on the other hand are naturally more than happy to celebrate the demise of Ireland's former oppressors, who did so much damage to its ancient culture and language.\n\nIn the north, loyalists have been struck with dismay and horror as the monarchy they have upheld and vowed to defend, even at the price of cooperating with their age-old Irish Catholic foes, appears in mortal danger. For the majority of moderate loyalism, this has only reinforced their determination to stand alongside [Root.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in opposition to their mutual enemies, despite their misgivings.
