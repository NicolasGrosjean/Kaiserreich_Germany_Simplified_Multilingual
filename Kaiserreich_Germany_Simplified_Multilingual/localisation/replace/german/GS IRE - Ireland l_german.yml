 IRE_totalist_party_long: "Saor Éire\n§gSaor Éire, meaning \"Free Ireland\", was formed by Peadar O'Donnell after his ejection from Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin following the British Revolution, when the left wing of the party was purged due to the anti-socialist fervour in Ireland at the time.\n\nAs far as Saor Éire are concerned, the Irish Revolution of the early 1920s was one of the worst missed opportunities in Irish history, even by their own standards. They believe had only the masses just been a little more educated, a little more informed, just a little bit more class conscious, a Worker's Republic could have been achieved, instead of the \"bourgeois\" one that took its place. For Saor Éire, imperialism and capitalism are two sides of the same exploitative force, one which must be violently purged from Ireland. Related to this, is an intense distrust of the clergy from within the party, particularly their conservatism and \"trappings of wealth and excess\".\n\nThe ranks of Saor Éire are filled with bitter veterans of the War of Independence, who make up the resurrected underground paramilitary wing of the party, the Irish Citizen Army. However, their progress has been stunted for years by two major stumbling blocks: Firstly, the rather robust nature of the reactionary Irish state, which has done what it can to dissolve the party, and secondly, the constant internal bickering over how involved the Union of Britain should be in their struggle. Saor Éire attempt to appeal to the poorest in Irish society, particularly farmers and farm workers, and their vision for the future is as agrarian as it is militant and radical.§!\n"
 IRE_syndicalist_party_text: "§gThe Irish Syndicalist Party was founded during the War of Independence by Roddy Connolly, son of the martyred James Connolly, following his return from the Commune of France after being there seeking international support for Ireland's revolution. This iteration was quickly put down by the British government, and the party was later revived by Jim Larkin Jnr. in the late 1920s, as a spiritual successor to his father's banned party, the Irish Worker's League. The ISP espouses the beliefs of orthodox syndicalism and republicanism, and sees itself as continuing the legacy of James Connolly's efforts in 1916, and the several small Soviets that formed during the War of Independence.\n\nOne of the major challenges in the implementation of syndicalism in Ireland is the lack of a major industrial base, and in an effort to combat this, the ISP has been in discussion the France and Britain, in seeking international support for building up Ireland's industry, should the party's revolutionary efforts come to fruition. While officially banned, the party is led by Jim Larkin Snr., and is largely made up of the more radical former Labour Party and trade union members who have been expelled from their respective organisations due their more ardent socialist leanings. Being very much an internationalist party, the ISP's goals can be summarised by James Connolly himself; \"For our demands most moderate are, we only want the earth.\"§!\n"
 IRE_radical_socialist_party_text: "§gThe Progressive Labour Party are the newest political party in Ireland, formed out of the anti-radical purges performed in the Labour Party. Of course if you were to ask their founder, former student activist Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, he would have left the party because of opposition to the purges regardless. Made up of much of the former student wing of Labour, as well as some more senior dissidents within the party, the PLP take a dim view on any form of repression of civil liberties. Unsurprisingly, this puts them at odds with the incumbent Sinn Féin administration, but their non-confrontational parliamentary demeanour has meant that their existence is tolerated, for now.\n\nTheir policies on social justice include supporting the abolition of the death penalty, removal of all political censorship, protections of freedom of speech, and pro-feminism views. Campaigning for a more encompassing welfare state than the mainstream Labour Party, with whom they share the belief of workers' rights, they also promote large scale formation of cooperative businesses and encourage farm collectivisation. They are noted to be avowedly pacifist in international terms and be willing to work with other left-wing parties owing to their small support base mostly consisting of the same kind of young progressives that make up the party itself.§!\n"

 IRE_social_democrat_party_text: "§g$IRE_social_democrat_party_text_start$\n\nShocked by the British Revolution, the Labour Party have now eschewed the revolutionary methods of abroad, for purely reformist means. This, as well as the anti-syndicalist measures taken from within the party to root out potential entryism, has led to several prominent members leaving in disagreement, from both the more militant and more liberal wings.\n\nAlongside worker's rights, Labour's policies include widespread social and industrial reform, brought about by income redistribution, extensive infrastructure projects, and publicly-owned universal public services. Their main support comes from Ireland's limited urban industrial base, but their progressive policies have consistently attracted the attention of a small number of the more liberal upper-middle class.§!\n"
 IRE_social_liberal_party_long: "$IRE_social_liberal_party_short$\n§gThe recently founded Clann na Talmhan, or \"Family of the Land\", would have more in common with the agrarian parties of Eastern Europe than other \"liberal\" parties. Formed in response to disillusionment against the more urban-focused government, and the perceived favouring of their more wealthy counterparts, the party's support is based around promoting the interests of the smaller farmers, particularly in the west of the country. Often considered somewhat anti-establishment and populist, they are regularly heard in Leinster House bemoaning the state of rural Ireland, and criticising all those who have it all, and who don't do enough for the man who lives and works on the land.\n\nIn practical terms, they call for land reclamation, lowering the taxes on farming land, and greater afforestation. Officially the party also supports social democratic policies such as state-funded secondary and subsidised university education, as well as publicly-owned healthcare. However, these are not seen as a priority for their limited support base, which unsurprisingly finds itself to be predominantly conservative and rural.§!\n"
 IRE_market_liberal_party_text: "§gThe National Development Party was founded by Seán Lemass in 1932, after he left Sinn Féin due to his disillusionment with the Collins administrations' further consolidation of power, and repression of radical politics. Being the only sitting TD to leave the party at the time, the NDP was set up alongside the unlikely partners of the National League Party and National Centre Party, both very small remnants of the old Irish Parliamentary Party, who favoured autonomy within the United Kingdom as opposed to independence.\n\nThe fledgling party's support is composed therefore of some members of the Anglo-Irish community, the more wealthy \"big farmers\", and parts of the urban middle class, as well as Lemass' small cohort of followers from Sinn Féin. Such as this, the party would be more Anglophilic than others, while still advocating complete independence, and would class itself as being very pro-business and fiscally conservative. The party see Mitteleuropa as an excellent opportunity to benefit from foreign investment, and hold an ambivalent view on religion and the Church. Seeing all political and social issues in Ireland through the prism of economics, the party believe wealth creation and thorough modernisation should be the key goal of any government.§!\n"
 IRE_social_conservative_party_long: "$IRE_social_conservative_party_short$\n§gAn Saorstát Críostúil, meaning \"the Christian Republic\", reflects the values of this party headed by Éamon de Valera. The party traces its origins to a split-off from Sinn Féin after the 1922 election, when Cathal Brugha would leave the party over disagreements regarding social policy and Collins' role in government, creating \"Cumann an tSaorstáit\", or \"Society of the Republic\". After an underwhelming term in office following a surprise win in the 1926 election, the party has regrouped with former Príomh Aire de Valera taking up leadership, along with changing the party's name and pushing it to his specific vision.\n\nAn Saorstát Críostúil draw quite a number of their views directly from Catholic doctrine, and would favour more development of Ireland's existing agrarianism over further industrialisation. The party would find themselves firmly more conservative than Sinn Féin on social matters, but is to Sinn Féin's left economically, as they are more willing to consider certain \"social justice\"-based policies advocated by the Church. Breaking with his predecessor, de Valera is somewhat hostile to the Mitteleuropa project and aspires to keep Ireland in splendid isolation away from the horrors of the coming storms.§!\n"
 IRE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long_text: "Sinn Féin\n§gSinn Féin, meaning \"Ourselves\", have undoubtedly been the pre-eminent party in Ireland since the mid-1910s. The oldest party in the state, they were founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, originally promoting a Dual Monarchy between Great Britain and Ireland akin to Austria-Hungary, proposing that Irish MPs abstain from Westminster and instead meet in Dublin. Although they remained abstentionist, this policy radically shifted to republicanism following the party being erroneously credited with the Easter Rising of 1916. Griffith remained working with the party, handed over party leadership to surviving 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, and the party steamrolled into power in the 1918 Home Rule Election, foregoing any British authority and instead forming Dáil Éireann in Dublin.\n\nAfter the small split in the party following the War of Independence and subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, it has been the current party's vision that has moulded the young republic. Seen as the party of the Irish middle class, they have formed the pillars of Law, Order, Religious Pluralism and International Trade. While being just to the right of centre on political and economic matters, Sinn Féin are considered to be socially liberal and somewhat cosmopolitan in the Irish context."

With Lemass and his associates refusing to be at the helm of a British puppet regime, the National Centre Party have reverted to their old name and policies, focusing their economic efforts on benefiting the big farmers and producing agricultural goods for the British market.

He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

 ireland.9.d: "In the past few years, while the Irish economy did not exactly boom, it enjoyed a relatively stable growth, particularly in the industrial sector where many have found themselves drawn to the cities with the promise of a reliable wage. While Ireland remains one of the most agrarian nations in Europe, this shift has led to the development of what could be seen as a proper \"working class\" as was previously only seen in the industrial heartland of the north. This promise of steady growth and steady jobs was one of the carrots Sinn Féin had been able to rely on in order to ensure support in urban areas.\n\nWith the economic trauma resulting from the recent crash of the German markets, all this has come to an end. As the Irish economy continues to contract more and more, factories are beginning to shut down, leaving their former employees without any alternative employment to turn to. With the meagre savings they may have kept starting to run dry, many now feel a building resentment towards the incumbent Sinn Féin government who can no longer position themselves as the party of prosperity.\n\nWithout this unspoken contract between them and their voters, many now find themselves wondering why they should bother voting for a status-quo party to begin with? Labour promises salvation for the workers who have been left behind by Sinn Féin, while Saorstát Críostúil acts as a refuge for those on the right who fear the prospect of a Labour government.\n\nSinn Féin is now faced with the nightmare of any incumbent party, it must somehow try to ask voters to forget all they have previously done and show that this time, they will be different."

 ireland.32.d.end: "However, in the same manner that Sinn Féin before SC was sunk in the people's eyes by the many concessions made to the Ulster Democratic Party, so too may SC's prospective allies the NDP, possessing a more laissez-faire economic outlook and an Anglophilic streak, being mainly descended from the remnants of the Irish Parliamentary Party, are asking for terms beyond the boundaries of reason. Balancing the desires of his supporters with those of his coalition partners shall prove vital should de Valera wish to avoid the political fate of his most bitter rival."
 ireland.33.d1: "As SC suspected beforehand, the Anglophile leanings of many of the National Development Party's notables have resulted in problems arising as they engaged in talks to form a government. The NDP's leader Seán Lemass, although nowhere near as pro-British as his fellows, is a sternly pragmatic man who unlike SC, spares little sympathy for the plight of Northern Catholics, and regards the resuscitation of the Irish economy as the utmost priority, fearing that alienating loyalists while the effects of Black Monday still continue to take their detrimental toll on the island, might derail any efforts by sparking instability.\n\nHe has insisted that An Saorstát Críostúil must agree to avoid the issue of the Ulster Privileges as a condition for the formation of any coalition between SC and the NDP. Éamon de Valera and his party, on the other hand, are keenly aware that should such the news of such an agreement be leaked in the currently heated political environment, the consequences could be disastrous. As a cunning negotiator and possessing a good personal and working relationship with Lemass, de Valera could try to haggle with Lemass on this matter, pledging to bring Ireland's financial situation under control first, and resolve the issue of the Privileges afterwards, though some of Lemass's colleagues will be less than pleased."
 ireland.34.d2: "With the National Development Party refusing to budge on the Ulster Privileges, Éamon de Valera became reluctantly convinced of the necessity to form a coalition with Aontas Náisiúnta. Eoin O'Duffy, keen to legitimise his party in the mainstream and regain his position as a major figure in the running of the country, eagerly opened negotiations, though neither men particularly trusted the other. In exchange for AN's support, de Valera agreed that a commission on corporatist economic policies would be established and an uncompromising line on Ulster taken, aiming for the ultimate abolition of the privileges.\n\nAlthough both believed membership of Mitteleuropa to have negative ramifications for Irish sovereignty, the two leaders concluded that a slow and steady approach was necessary to loosen ties with the bloc without worsening the financial crisis.\n\nThe announcement of the new administration has permeated its way through Irish society. Hardline nationalists and anti-syndicalists are delighted by the result, hoping that SC and AN will restore order and stability to the nation, as are the Church and faithful voters at seeing a government based on Christian principles, after years of Sinn Féin's quasi-secularism. In Ulster, a visible sense of hope is felt on the streets and in the homes of Catholic areas, concerns about Brugha's previous failure to change the Ulster Privileges dampened by the expectation that AN should ensure \"Dev\" keeps his word. The mood among Protestants is quite the contrary, their seething discontent with Dublin only intensening, to the deep concern of local Gardaí who have already begun to pick up rumours in the wind of radical loyalists beginning to stockpile weapons."
 ireland.1000.d.GER.pataut: "$ireland.1000.d.GER$\n\nThe episode has provoked discord inside the new cabinet as the hesitancy of Kleist, a man long less keen on Weltpolitik, to stoke foreign tensions while Germany faces turmoil at home has clashed with Hassell's support for the Irish in light of not only his anti-syndicalist and Anglophobic views, but also his naval connections, aware of the island's strategic use to Germany. After discussions between the two, it was agreed that Hassell would issue a strongly-worded condemnation of the incident and assure that the "German sword and shield" would stand behind the Irish against syndicalist aggression, so as to deter the British from further transgressions, but that for now the German response would remain diplomatic."

Harry Midgley's NILP, though officially non-sectarian, have become a party primarily of the Protestant working class, and there exist whispers of support for the union of Northern Ireland with the Union of Britain, with rhetoric playing on resentment that the upper class in 1926 \"chose money over Ulster\". The UPL, led by former UUP politician James Hanna McCormick, is stridently anti-Catholic and also regard the UDP as traitors, calling for a policy of abstentionism toward Dáil Éireann. With these changes, the UDP's position as the big-tent representative of the Protestant community is no longer as certain as it once was."

 ireland.1050.d2.gerend: "With the western republic now firmly aligned with Germany, this might prove itself a significant boon in a future war against the Internationale, as the access of German forces to bases on the island provides them with a strategic location from which they can threaten Great Britain by imposing a naval blockade on and claiming aerial dominance over the island, eventually preparing the ground for an invasion."

 ireland.2002.d.ENT1: "It can be tough to move on from the past, particularly when it is with those who have wronged you time and time again. And yet, when Ireland decided to reach out to the Entente powers, it attempted to forget their role as the continuation of the British Empire, believing that they had been humbled by their expulsion from their homelands. The government assumed that the British would be eager to acquire a new ally located so close to their homelands, a potential jumping-off point for their envisioned homecomings.\n\n And yet, it appears that the Irish Government had placed too much faith in their ability to work for a better future, as the Entente leadership has seemingly rejected oits efforts to join their alliance. For many in [IRE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is hard not to feel that the British are back to their usual tricks, leaving us out to dry when the going gets rough."
 ireland.2002.d.ENT2: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, and often produces strange bedfellows. Ireland had assumed that considering its rather precarious diplomatic situation, that perhaps it could find some common ground with the Entente, who have spent much of the past two decades in a near-constant state of existential crisis.\n\n Unfortunately it appears that these expectations were not to be long for this world, as the leadership of the Entente have largely dashed any hopes Ireland had of being admitted to their alliance. While their reasons were not given, many cannot help but feel that the Irish general apathy to their expulsions has played a part, which is a claim even the most anglophilic in the country have struggled to deny. Regardless of the reasons, the fact remains that Ireland is on its own."

Though the state he has shaped is nominally democratic, its voting process and corporatist structures are designed to ensure that those elected are not Anglophilic, Jewish or Masonic elements wily enough to hoodwink the masses, but rather men and women of virtue.\n\nWith power consolidated securely in the hands of those who uphold patriotism, Christianity and Ireland's native tongue, Sceilg, as a strong chief akin to the Taoisigh of old at the country's helm, watches vigilantly over the Republic he rescued from those who sought to defile it and the sacrifices made by so many Irish martyrs. Like Daniel O'Connell, who he admired in spite of O'Connell's moderacy, it is certain that O'Kelly will go down in the history books as a great liberator, having fulfilled his lifelong mission to safeguard the isle and its ancient culture from the scourges of liberalism, imperialism and syndicalism alike."

The very forefathers of the Gaelic race originated from Iberia, and Hibernian monks carried out their holy endeavours across Europe at the height of Irish civilisation. After the English conquest, many nobles and commoners alike sought refuge on the continent during the 16th and 17th centuries. But it was the so-called famine of the 1840s that did the most damage, halving the Irish population through a combination of mass death and exile, and creating a culture of emigration that would see the island's demographics unremittingly decrease for nearly a century afterwards.\n\nIt would take the improvement of Ireland's economic situation following the nation's entry into Mitteleuropa, and the fall of America and Britain into chaos and revolution respectively to bring this lengthy decline to an end, though some would continue to emigrate to the likes of Canada and Germany. The flow of people leaving the isle would lessen further during Black Monday, due to the global nature of the crisis. However, as a result of dissatisfaction with the integralist government and recovering financial circumstances elsewhere, Ireland now faces another wave of emigrants.\n\nÓ Cuinneagáin has denounced such exiles as "péistí", meaning "worms" in English, accusing them of deserting their native land and harbouring syndicalist sympathies. Acting to stem the tide of migrants, the coast guard has been placed on patrol to halt any illegal rafts fleeing the island, and a series of harsh decrees proclaimed requiring Irish citizens to seek approval from the state before departing from the country or returning from abroad. Said permission is only to be granted under stringent conditions, and a severe sentence is to be imposed for unauthorised travel. Through these decisive measures, the authorities hope to prevent a brain drain and ensure that Irish demographics will soon rise back to their pre-famine heights."

 ireland.3900.d1: "With Ireland now a part of the Internationale - and a partner to Britain - an unusual political issue has emerged: Oliver Cromwell. Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."

 irelandflavour.362.d: "This morning in Ireland we have awoken to grave news coming from Algiers, the capital of the remnants of what many here consider the legitimate government of France, that has left many in our young republic shaken. General Charles de Gaulle, who seized control of the state after a brief civil conflict, officially addressed the French parliament yesterday to announce his intentions to restore the House of Orléans to the French throne and abolish the Third Republic once and for all. Prince Jean, the Orléanist pretender to the crown, quickly accepted de Gaulle's invitation and although he is yet to be coronated it is clear to all that French republicanism is finally dead.\n\nIt is no secret that most republican movements in Europe were greatly inspired by France, and in Ireland this rings especially true. Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish republicanism, was both heavily inspired and directly supported by French republicans in his uprisings against the British crown. Even the most fundamental symbol of our state, the Irish tricolour, was created by French republican women celebrating the ousting of Louis Philippe I, great-grandfather of the new king, as a symbol of our common struggle for liberty and freedom.\n\nThis news has greatly emboldened the extremists on both the left and right in Ireland, who have already begun with their doomsaying predictions as to the future of Irish democracy. Those on the extreme right have declared this to be definitive proof that liberalism and democracy are too flawed to combat the threat posed by syndicalist forces, advocating for the creation of a modern Irish monarchy to protect our nation. Likewise those on the extreme left have interpreted this news as a sign that bourgeois democracy cannot stop the rise of reactionary authoritarianism, and see socialism as the only way to guarantee Irish liberty. We can only hope that both are equally deluded."

However, Conefrey has found a somewhat bold new line of attack, denouncing Jazz as \"borrowed from Central Africa by a gang of wealthy syndicalists in the USA to strike at Christian civilisation throughout the world\" and branding listeners as outright \"traitors\" to Ireland, with particular venom spit towards Anglo-Irish and German residents for their indulgence of the genre.\n\nConefrey's angst-ridden views that strike at all things foreign and metropolitan saw him able to amass reportedly \"several thousand\" supporters at a recent anti-Jazz protest in south Leitrim. Letters of support from Éamon de Valera and Archbishop Joseph MacRory were read from a platform, and verbal attacks were made on politicians espousing cultural pluralist views. It would be difficult to imagine such galvanisation a decade ago but its clear that recent economic and political events have added fuel to this fire."

O'Kelly cannot deny the debt owed to the United Irishmen, he aims to take Irish republicanism in a direction akin to the classical republican ideal of a mixed government, combining a "monarchy" embodied by a strong presidency, an "aristocracy" of republicans and Gaelic revivalists, and democracy via elections and corporate councils.

 irelandflavour.3810.d.start: "For the anniversary of the retirement of late historian and Senator Alice Stopford Green, a work has been published which examines an area of her interest — Irish nationalism among Protestants and the Anglo-Irish. Given her own background, this subject matter came of no surprise.\n\nThe book argues the irrefutability that since 1798, the Anglo-Irish have played a crucial role in the development of Irish nationalism and republicanism. Anglo-Irish and Protestants never made up more than 15% of the population, and while they would have been overwhelmingly loyalist historically, those who took up the nationalist cause made a disproportionate impact in nationalism as a whole.\n\nFrom the founders of Irish republicanism, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the movement's leadership has included Protestants, helped by the greater status and education that was afforded to them for centuries. Robert Emmet led his rebellion in 1803, and Charles Stewart Parnell was de facto leader of nationalism in the 1880s. Outside politics, literary greats Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats are also known for their nationalist ideals. The involvement of Protestants in nationalism, it argues, was key in separating the Catholic identity from the Irish one in the late 1700s, a time when they were entwined.\n\nThe book goes as far as contemporary Ireland, focusing on the fringes of politics, such as socialist academic Benjamin Farrington, or integralism proponent Ernest Blythe, and commenting on how the British Revolution may have influenced the popularity of different political groups among this population."

 irelandflavour.3812.d3: "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, especially in recent years as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Even those in government need a break from it all every now and then, especially with their ongoing arduous task of reshaping the political landscape of the country. The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\". Following such high praise and positive reviews, it can only be hoped that this is just the beginning of a new exciting era of Irish theatre."

The creation of the new Provincial Council was announced earlier today by the President of the GAA, making it very clear that the GAA's plans to foster the rebirth of Irish culture in Britain are only just beginning.\n\nAlthough at present only the London and Lancashire county boards make up the newly established British GAA, there is already discussion on how to properly incorporate the more minor county boards of Warwickshire, Yorkshire, and Gloucestershire into the GAA while also establishing proper county boundaries across Britain. Steps have already been taken in Ireland to help foster the growth of the Games in Britain, with this year's annual congress finally abolishing the archaic Rule 21 which banned all members of British security forces from joining the GAA.\n\nWhile Ireland will almost certainly remain the home and core of the Games, many are hopefully within a few decades the British scene will have fully established itself as a key part of the GAA with tefams from both countries competing against each other."
