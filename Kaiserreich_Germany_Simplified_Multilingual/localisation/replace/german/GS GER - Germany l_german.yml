Not long after that day in February, Reichskanzler Herbert von Dirksen announced his resignation, offering little comments to the press or to the members of the Reichstag. Though a competent diplomat, Dirksen's composure and character of a vain, pompous aristocrat left him isolated in high politics, and he never managed to shake off the veneer of being a royal appointment, less legitimate than partisan chancellors in the post-March German Empire. His Vice-Chancellor, Heinrich Brüning, refused to seek the Kaiser's appointment as the next Reichskanzler. After the Black Monday crisis, the office became a poisoned chalice.\n\nSeeing little initiative from the parties in the Reichstag, Wilhelm II appointed the current Minister-President of Prussia, Siegfried von Roedern, as the new Reichskanzler. An elder civil servant with years of experience in the Federal and Prussian governments alike, he currently heads a nonpartisan government of the centre and right in Prussia, staffed with right-wing politicians and nonpartisan professionals. Though his government is not planning to survive the April election, it has a lot on his plate regardless."
 germany_schleicher_events.5.d_krw: "Under the advice of his advisors, Wilhelm II, as King of Prussia, accepted Schleicher's petition and appointed him as the next Minister-President of Prussia, making him the first Reichskanzler to also be the Prussian Minister-President in over a decade. The move has generally received negative reactions from the Prussian legislature, and has been decried on the left as a threatening expansion of Schleicher's power - however, most of the political establishment accepted the decision without much fanfare. In his opening speech before the Prussian House of Representatives, Schleicher stated that he intends to maintain the spirit of cooperation fostered by his predecessor, Siegfried von Roedern, and his first action will be to establish and expand work relief programmes across the Kingdom."

As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own.

He was already a second lieutenant when the Weltkrieg broke out, where he served as a communications officer in charge of signals intelligence of the 4th Army. Guderian fought at Verdun, in Italy and was finally stationed in Poland at the end of the war.\n\nHad he not met the famous Weltkrieg tank commander, Ernst Volckheim, Guderian might have continued along the traditional Prussian path. However, Volckheim's controversial ideas about the primacy of armoured units inspired Guderian greatly. During the 1920s he became a prolific scholar of armoured warfare and followed closely the emerging French theories of the \"guerre de mouvement.\" However, his stubborn insistence on the new doctrine and piercing sarcasm did not make him very popular among the German General Staff, and in 1927 he was \"promoted\" to act as military attaché to King August IV, and given the responsibility of overseeing and training the Polnische Wehrmacht into a modern fighting force.\n\nDespite being de facto exiled to Poland, and any career advancement, Guderian decided to put his theories into practice with the Polish army. He has gathered a clique of like-minded officers such as Oswald Lutz and even some Poles, like Władysław Anders, and most importantly, Guderian managed to convince the Polish government to support his vision of the war of the future - no doubt seeing a small, elite army as an option that would in the long term prove to be cheaper and more popular than mass conscription. By 1936, Guderian has worked tirelessly with his Panzer divisions, leading the modernisation of the Polish army and their doctrine for any future war.§!"

Due to his father's early death, he had to leave school without graduation and found work as a sales assistant in Frankfurt. He found socialism through unionisation - working to unionise sales assistants in his city, he ended up involved with the Free Trade Unions and joined the SPD itself. By 1905, he had amassed enough influence with his activism that August Bebel pushed him forward as a party secretary - however, the unions, which believed that Müller was too left-wing, blocked his candidacy.\n\nBy the Weltkrieg, Müller had moderated - he sharply criticised Rosa Luxemburg and positioned himself in the party's centre, between the revolutionary left and the right-wing revisionists. Still, for a time, he lost influence to Friedrich Ebert and Philip Scheidemann. Again, he answered with a pivot - this time a bit more to the left, preying onto the frustration with the party's cooperation with the Brockdorff cabinet and passivity, he advocated a more aggressive approach that could neuter the March Coalition and allow the formation of a centre-left democratic government. In 1930, he was finally elected as one of SPD's co-chairmen - the party's uncompromising position towards the Dirksen Cabinet that helped sabotage it in the leadup to the 1936 election is the result of his agitation.\n\nMuch like his father, a follower of Ludwig Feuerbach, Müller is irreligious.§!"

 GER_march_to_april_desc: "The March Reforms to the Bismarckian Constitution, approved in 1920 after the fall of the OHL regime, laid the groundwork for a new era of genuine constitutionalism in the German Empire. A postwar consensus soon developed under the so-called \"March Coalition\" of the liberal parties and Zentrum, which sought to retain the achievements of March, tactically cooperate with the left or the right to prevent either of them from gaining power, and finalise the glorious conclusion to Weltpolitik. Content with keeping the SPD and the DVLP away from the Chancellorship, Wilhelm II endorsed this consensus, approving their Chancellors and offering cooperative ones elsewhere.\n\nThis consensus has come to an end. Decline of the Liberale Volkspartei, the arrogant and toady attitude of Chancellor Herbert von Dirksen, and growth of Reichstag's \"Permanent Opposition\" have all contributed to its death. In mid 1935, the March Coalition dissolved, and the Chancellor now has almost no support in the Reichstag. Defying expectations, the SPD and DVLP refused to call for a vote of no confidence against the Chancellor, intending to leave him rot in the skeletal throne until the elections to the Reichstag this April. The beginning of April will cause the death of March."

It has now been made certain in the minds of the German population that the Imperial German Army is unstoppable - France has been beaten twice and Russia has been thoroughly dismantled. Even this victory did not make the brilliant minds of the Deutsches Heer rest - new weapons and techniques of war such as armoured vehicles and combined arms have been adapted to the traditional doctrine of mobile warfare, and the Luftstreitkräfte was established as an independent air force after a pitched political brawl in 1927.\n\nAs invincible as the German army seems, however, it suffers as an institution. The laurels of victory hide lacking central coordination, dominance of the military by aristocrats and vitriolic interservice rivalry. The Heer has become divided into cliques, each with their own way to resolve the crisis, while motivation to reform the military among the civilian government is at an all time low - but if Germany is to win the inevitable Second Weltkrieg, these problems must be resolved."

 germany_events.9.d: "The formation of Roedern's nonpartisan government was taken as an affront by Germany's numerous federal states, especially the south — Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden viewed the formation of a government dominated by Prussian officials with extreme suspicion. Their governments, mainly led by Zentrum and the LVP, also did not appreciate their respective parties being shut out of the government by the Reichskanzler. The result was that in the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house composed of representatives of its member states, a hostile majority has formed against the Reichskanzler, composed of the Southern states and numerous minor states who have joined in protest against the Reichskanzler.\n\nThough Zentrum and the LVP led the attack against the Reichskanzler, it was the SPD who benefitted in the election polls the most. Their campaign and Reichstag delegation took advantage of the political drama to protest the \"bureaucratisation of the government\" and the growing trend of lacking Reichskanzler accountability to the Reichstag - which spells out the necessity for further democratic reform in the Empire."
 germany_events.14.d: "Reorganisation is taking place among the German parties, as long suspected collaboration between the conservative agrarian DkP and the far-right DVLP has been officially announced by their chairmen, Kuno von Westarp and Ulrich von Hassell. This agreement entails raising joint candidates in key constituencies and a common chancellor nominee for the upcoming elections. In an official statement, both parties have described the alliance as a necessary measure to "defend the German banner from ceaseless partisanship and societal decline", reflected in the alliance name - \"Schwarz-Weiß-Rot\" (Black-White-Red), the colours of the Imperial flag.\n\nThe left has already criticised the duplicity of this alliance of convenience. Since 1923, the DkP has been involved in every government without interruption and epitomises the partisan establishment that the DVLP claims to be fighting against. Earlier right-wing cooperation had failed to materialise throughout the 20s and 30s due to leadership disagreements and the overlapping voting blocs of the two parties, as well as the DkP's convenient position within the March Coalition. The altered political climate post-Black Monday, however, has led to a change of mind - old hurdles fade away as closer links between the old conservative establishment and the radical nationalist opposition are being forged..."
 germany_events.16.d: "Finding themselves under increasingly greater competition, Zentrum branches in competitive regions, such as Silesia, Westphalia and Hanover, have been struggling to maintain their ground against popular Social Democratic and right-wing candidates. To alleviate this disparity, Zentrum candidates and party branches have begun independently making deals with local parties to unite behind a common candidate in competitive districts and thus increase their chances of victory.\n\nIn Hanover, Zentrum has renewed its historic cooperation with the German-Hanoverian Party, commonly known as the Guelph Party (Welfen). A regionalist political party created after the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, it generally sat with Zentrum in the prewar Reichstag, however, the postwar years have seen it experience a sharp decline. The Guelph conservative federalism has struggled in the postwar environmment and losing their last lease of life might just prove to be the end of the party.\n\nOn the other side of the Empire, Zentrum members in Posen have begun expanding their collaboration with Polish autonomists, particularly those closer to the ChZJN in Poland proper. Unlike in Hanover, the Polish ethnic constituency has not lost its potency, although it still needs to compete with anti-Polish electoral pacts in mixed constituencies. For them, much like for the Welfen, Zentrum is a natural ally, as they are both ideologically conservative and concerned with maintaining the federal model of the state, with hope of decentralising it further, against centralist encroachment from the left and the right alike. Not everyone in Zentrum subscribes to the idea of tagging along with a flock of weak minor parties, however."
 germany_events.17.d: "Alfred Hugenberg, 2nd Chairman of the DVLP, is among the Fatherland Party's most prominent faces, below only Ulrich von Hassell. Though his position is largely symbolic, a token compromise made to the party's reactionary old guard after Hassell's rise to power in 1929, he commands a notable clique within the DVLP and keeps it alive through his considerable wealth. As one of Germany's most powerful businessmen and press barons, Hugenberg is in charge of the gigantic "Hugenberg Group", a media empire controlling newspapers, publishers and advertising agencies across the Empire - their papers sell hundreds of thousands of copies and hold considerable sway on public opinion. Of course, their articles are biased towards Hugenberg's preferred beliefs, rabid anti-Socialism and anti-Semitism.\n\nThe 1936 electoral campaign has given the DVLP hope that they can position themselves as the leader of an all-right coalition in the Reichstag after the election, so the party's central committee has requested a mass propaganda drive from the 2nd Chairman. An aggressive promotion campaign for the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten and Der Tag, expansion of the Telegraphen-Union news agency and promotion of their articles to more and more newspapers, perhaps even a few movie deals - all could serve to form the desired image of the old Party of Tirpitz out there.\n\nWhere should the resources of the campaign be concentrated, however? Focusing on the Illustrierte Nachtausgabe and cutting deals with urban newspapers will improve the DVLP's chances to win the middle class in the cities and cut down social democratic growth - on the other hand, the Telegraphen-Union has fostered good relations with independent rural news outlets, and investing more in this relationship will aid the conservative cause in the Prussian countryside."
 germany_events.18.d: "It had been anticipated ever since the February market crash, but it has now become clear - the breakdown of the German economy has greatly bolstered the far left of the political spectrum. Socialist propaganda has swept up thousands of workers across the nation, offering an easy answer to the confusion of many workers thrown out of their job because of factors they could not control. It is because the illusion of prosperity that the bourgeoisie, the Junkers and the Kaiser at the top maintained has shattered - the final hour of international capitalism is at hand, so make sure to stand in line and hoist the red flag!\n\nThe German far left parties are generally small and fractured, and though they are not banned, they are only somewhat tolerated by the political establishment. After years of splits and reunions, the Communist Workers' Party of Germany (KAPD) has garnered most of the socialist share. Though supportive of French-style syndicalism, the KAPD holds some reservations, believing that trade unions in Germany have become hopelessly reformist and so the revolutionary vanguard must be factory councils of workers - hence, \"council communism\". The Communist Party of Germany (KPD) is also prominent, distinguished by the fact that they participate in electoral politics, unlike their cousins.\n\nIn spite of bad blood between the numerous factions of the far left, they find the strength to cooperate from time to time - and today is one of those cases. The KAPD, KPD and their aligned trade unions are planning a mass demonstration in Berlin on International Workers' Day, May 1st, and expect to be joined by similar events in the Rhineland and Saxony."
 germany_events.19.d: "In response to growing militancy of the German workers and citing previous sporadic cases of violence during the electoral campaign, the police force of Berlin issued a ban on open-air political gatherings in the city during May 1, aiming to prevent the planned May Day demonstrations. This did not deter far left activists, however, and even emboldened some — these restrictions appeared to affirm the official party line of the KAPD that capitalism has entered its Third Period, and so will respond to workers' movements with more and more draconian force.\n\nDemonstrations took place across the city, rough tallies of the numbers showed that threats of police violence balanced out the growing socialist membership, meaning that the size of the KAPD and KPD gatherings were hardly larger than normal. Still, Berlin Police responded with force, sending out flying squads and attacking with truncheons wherever demonstrations were reported. Even the lawful conventions, such as SPD and liberal trade union assemblies, were mistaken for socialist protests and attacked. Street combat broke out in the socialist-dominated Wedding district, but it was one-sided and only served to escalate police response — live rounds were fired upon KAPD demonstrations and over thirty people were killed by the end of the day. Around 200 were injured and 1200 were arrested by the police.\n\nDistribution of Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung was curtailed in the aftermath to suppress the casualty numbers, but the message spread across the nation nonetheless, and further inflamed friction between the government and the labour movement. The events were largely viewed positively by the right wing of the Reichstag, while the liberals and SPD were more divided — in particular, while the SPD newspaper Vorwärts produced a scathing piece stating that the KAPD was \"seeking to intentionally sacrifice supporters' lives\", the Social Democratic delegation in the Reichstag officially protested the actions of Berlin policemen and demanded an investigation. Their demands fell on deaf ears, however, while tensions continue to rise."
 germany_events.20.d: "The economic crisis has sparked discussions across various ideological circles and associations — the traditional consensus among German economists has failed, or, at least, is no longer being trusted by the average worker and politician. Witnessing millions being thrown to the streets and dozens of banks collapsing overnight, parties, associations and trade unions now look towards the government for potential salvation. That state intervention may help drive up demand and reinvigorate the economy during the financial cycle has been contemplated during the interwar period and these ideas have only gained more traction since Black Monday.\n\nThe journal of the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), Die Arbeit, has opened discussion on what they have named \"active economic policy\" after the publication of a political economic programme by the trade unionists Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade. This plan, titled the "Tarnow-Baade Plan" after its creators, posits the creation of massive public works which could employ up to one million people across the Empire, as well as tighter banking controls which would allow an extensive inflationary policy. According to Tarnow and Baade, work creation and fiscal inflation will provide relief for the poor and drive up demand, solving the downfall.\n\nThough the ADGB is closely allied with the SPD, the party has actually distanced itself from the Tarnow-Baade Plan. Otto Wels and Rudolf Hilferding have both criticised the ADGB for its direct intervention in politics, which should be delegated solely to the party, and for Tarnow and Baade's intentions to "play doctor at the bedside of capitalism". Undeterred, the trade unionists have been making waves across the press nonetheless, and earned the surprising endorsement of the Prussian Minister of War, Kurt von Schleicher, who described work creation as \"the only way out of today's plights\"."
 germany_events.24.desc: "Times could definitely be better for the Zentrum Party, the main representation of Catholic interests in German parliamentary politics. After many years of aimless leadership under the moderate Rhenish wing, two mediocre election results in 1931 and 1936, and the collapse of several government cabinets with Zentrum participation over the course of the last few years, Zentrum chairman Theodor von Guérard has officially announced his retreat from the leadership of his party. A party conference, the first in many years, has been called, and politically interested observers are convinced that it will be one of fierce party-internal confrontations. Throughout the last decade, new factions within Germany's oldest political party have sprung up like mushrooms and are willing to seize power and lead the party onto a new political course, but the question will be, what political wing will come out on top?"

 germany_events.36.d: "The right have now consolidated their hold over the government of Germany, and the chance of the incumbent cabinet falling due to pressure from the Reichstag appears increasingly narrow. As article after article is printed on grand plans to dismantle the already fairly weak parliamentary system in Germany in order to replace it with decades of right-wing dominance, social democrats grow increasingly uneasy. This concern is especially held among the young generation of the SPD - who, unlike their predecessors, have a far different image of politics. While the party elders entered leadership during the Anti-Socialist Laws of the late 19th century and thus swore to always seek the most legal path to power to avoid a second period of repression, the politicians born in the 1890s or later never experienced this and thus are far more aggressive, though not necessarily more ideologically radical.\n\nWithin chapters of the SPD, trade union meetings and socialist study groups, tense discussion is taking place on whether the Social Democrats should take to the streets to fight for the defence of democracy - and it seems a large bulk of the party's mass membership are swayed by this rhetoric. Leading members of the SPD's youth wing, such as Kurt Schumacher and Theodor Haubach, as well as the long forgotten yet existing radical left wing of the party, which includes such people as Max Seydewitz and Kurt Rosenfeld, have been recognised as the leaders of this move. Though the party central committee still expects to just wait out a short-lived period of right wing rule, not everyone believes that democracy will simply defend itself."

 germany_events.38.d: "The leadership of the democratic opposition has been under hard attack from the far left lately - publications by KAPD and KPD aligned papers have highly criticised their position, claiming that they lack the militancy necessary to defend Germany from the emergence of yet another reactionary dictatorship. Social Democratic and liberal leaders, fearing a threat to their leadership of the democratic movement, have responded in kind, attacking the socialists and syndicalists for their ceaseless call for division among the anti-reactionary front. All in all, it has been a very good week for us - the democrats have weakened their positions significantly."
 germany_events.40.d: "Our government policy has come under fire in the Reichstag — which Social Democratic deputies have been using as a tribune ever since the election of 1936. During debates on laws proposed by the cabinet, several of their MPs organised a protest, declaring our reforms to be a slap in the face of democracy and the \"achievements of the March Reforms to the Constitution\".\n\nIn addition, the agitators tried to appeal to the emotions of the deputies watching, asking them to vote against all government pilicies and join them in agitation to defend democratic principles. While reporting on this incident was muted in right-wing press, Social Democratic papers gave it front pages and significant coverage."
 germany_events.49.d: "The beginning of the Second Weltkrieg caught German society unprepared - and not only because Germany was not an instigator of the conflict this time. Since 1934, it has been occupied with internal conflicts partisan squabbles, all of which were far more relevant to the politicians and the common people than distant worries of another military conflict. Russian aggression in the East and syndicalist rearmament in the West were concerning, for sure, but the expectation was that the undefeated Imperial Germany Army will make quick work of the aggressors.\n\nAs a result, the German Empire enters the war unprepared, and rapid mobilisation policies will need to be passed in order to hasten our rise from slumber.

 germany_black_monday_events.7.d: "The German agricultural sector, struggling for years at this point, has suffered greatly from the economic crisis sparked by the Black Monday market crash. It is the latest step in the persistent decline of German agriculture ever since the late 19th century; the culmination of many years of inefficient and outdated methods, unfortunate global market developments and stalling, poorly future-oriented agrarian policies.\n\nCompared to its Western competitors, such as Britain or the United States, German agriculture has consistently lagged behind in efficiency. Twenty five percent of all arable land across the Empire is held by 0.2 percent of the land owners, most of which are operating in East Elbia. But since the late 20s, small and mid-sized farmers all across the nation have started to feel the effects of this looming efficiency crisis as well: Steady price erosion for agricultural goods due to cheaper competition from abroad and shrivelling purchasing power have slowly led many farmers into the never-ending downwards spiral of growing indebtedness.\n\nWhat could initially be battled via the reintroduction of protective tariffs and import quotas, undoubtedly a controversial policy instrument within Mitteleuropa, has at the end of the day only postponed the inevitable. With the collapse of the German banking sector, the looming crisis will soon aggravate as many estates and enterprises which have relied on loans to stay afloat are bound to default on these in the near future, and the collapsing demand for agricultural goods could be the nail in the coffin. This substantial crisis has already begun to fuel the DkP electoral campaign and placed the question of a drastically different agricultural policy on the agenda. What many have seem to forgotten, though, is the fact that the conservatives are partly responsible themselves for this dilemma, via their candidate in the State Secretariat of Agriculture, Martin Schiele, and his controversial agricultural policies during the last decade. For now, his political fate is on a knife's edge."

As such, no matter if they were on the left or the right, the Reichstag began to plot, seeking to overthrow the Reichskanzler with the power of no-confidence vote, granted to the Reichstag in the constitutional reforms of 1920.\n\nThe SPD and its allies, an informal alliance known as the \"Democratic Union\" (Demokratische Union), ultimately took the lead, forming a majority in the legislature and initiating a no-confidence vote, citing that the Reichskanzler could no longer manage the government under these conditions and must step down. Though Schleicher fought to the best of his ability, he was unable to break the will of the SPD, and he was forced out after a majority vote.\n\nHis role in history will thus be that of a mere interim period, an independent who led Germany for a few brief months before handing the reins over to the government of Hermann Müller. For the first time in the Empire's history, a Social Democrat has been begrudgingly appointed as the Reichskanzler - all of the Empire's resistance and conservatism could not stand against the march of history."

Though Schleicher fought to the best of his ability, he was unable to overcome the conservative resistance, and he was forced out after a majority vote.\n\nHis role in history will thus be that of a mere interim period, an independent who led Germany for a few brief months before handing the reins over to the government of Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin - an independent appointed to mediate between the two powerful coalition partners. For the first time in decades, a true conservative government leads Germany again - years of parliamentarisation, liberalism and reform could not hold back the reaction of the German conservatives, and they've returned with a vengeance."

Already, numerous protests actions, sometimes even violent ones, have been noticed springing up throughout the Ruhr..."
 germany_schleicher_events.20.t: "KAPD Calls for Armed Struggle in the Ruhr"
 germany_schleicher_events.20.d: "The beginning of the general strike in the Ruhr has emboldened far left organisations across Germany — on the other hand, they have welcomed the beginning of the strike with reservation. In the view of the syndicalists and radical socialists in the KAPD, KPD and other far-left parties, the last thing this mass movement should become is a mere battle for workers' rights — that is hopeless concessionism to the bourgeoisie upper class, which will merely make the revolution more distant rather than make it draw nearer.\n\nNewspapers such as Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung and Die Rote Fahne have begun calling for the Rhenish workers to establish dual rule in the Ruhr, replacing the state's organs with workers' councils which can manage the day to day affairs, provide leadership to the workers, and eventually replace the state entirely. The Marxist philosopher and one of the leading figures of the Berlin Tendency of the KAPD, Karl Korsch, called for the formation of \"Proletarian Hundreds\" to defend the brewing workers' rising from any attempts at suppression.\n\nThe Preußische Geheimpolizei has curtailed the distribution of this revolutionary material and has begun investigating both the KPD and KAPD for their state-threatening activity."
 germany_schleicher_events.26.d: "Under the leadership of Carl Severing, one of the main figures in the right wing of the SPD and a powerful figure in the Bielefeld SPD, a summit has been held between the main representatives of the government and the strikers. Regional representatives of political parties ranging from Zentrum to the KAPD, local trade union leaders, municipal dignitaries and representatives of the political executive committees of the strikers took seat, as well as a minister from Prussia and the central government each for observation and consultation.\n\nThe two priorities of the conference, as described by Severing, was to negotiate an armistice between the arming workers and the central government in a way that would not make either side resort to violence - and, second, a comprehensive settlement that would allow the workers to return to their jobs safely. The demands of the Ruhr workers have risen well beyond the wage increases which sparked the Ruhrkampf, however, and the government may not be interested in fulfilling their demands, either."
 germany_schleicher_events.26.b: "Isolate the KAPD and KPD, but make concessions to establishment unions."
 germany_schleicher_events.27.d: "The Bielefeld Summit is over, and has shown some promise. Moderate trade unionists among the Ruhr strikers are willing to compromise on some of their political programme in order to achieve material gains for the workers - and while the KAPD-influenced radicals are obviously not going to concede, cooperation with the moderates may leave them marginalised and thus turn the strike harmless. Of course, a lot more work is necessary to moderate the radicalism of the strike and contain its spread, and even the strikers who were receptive to compromise have not returned to work thus far, hoping to get even more gains by pressuring their factory owners a bit more."
 germany_schleicher_events.28.d: "Our attempt to negotiate with the Ruhr strikes has been met with failure. Even the moderate wing, more concerned with material gains than political objectives, chose to not waver from their programme and kept the trade unionist movement united, and the KAPD-influenced radicals were active as ever agitating for no compromises with the government. We will have to seek alternate approaches if we want to get the workers to return back to their factories."
 germany_schleicher_events.32.d: "The worst we could have expected has happened in the Ruhr - while making a speech in Essen, the Reichskanzler was fired upon from the crowd, causing mass panic and a riot which the city police forces only restrained after two hours of fighting and several lives. Schleicher survived the attack, but was wounded in the arm and had to be immediately hospitalised for an operation.\n\nAfter interrogations of captured rioters, the assailant has been identified as Erich Mielke - a member of the KAPD, trained by its self defence units in espionage, handling weapons and terrorism. The assassination attempt was planned by Mielke's unit in advance. Unfortunately, the failed assassin vanished in the crowd and escaped the grasp of justice, but the news coming from Essen have emboldened the government. The public demands action against these terrorists, and they shall provide."
 germany_schleicher_events.35.d: "The Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg passed the infamous Maulkuerfgesetz with a majority vote — however, this was not the end of the story. Enormous protests took to the streets in the small Western state, demanding Bech's resignation and the revocation of the antidemocratic \"muzzle law\". Criticism on the national level was equally fierce — numerous parties, including the SPD, LVP, and even the progressive elements of Zentrum lodged their criticism, especially as neither the Luxembourger government nor the major steel producers have even considered negotiation with the strikers.\n\nFrustrated with the opposition, Bech chose to put an end to this rhetoric once and for all, by announcing a referendum on the Maulkuerfgesetz — believing that he represents the \"silent minority\" outside the main working-class towns, he expects to win the referendum with a large margin and legitimise his authoritarian move."
 germany_schleicher_events.40.d: "The tensions and conflict in Germany have finally spilled over - and a terrifying spark has just been lit in the small, industrialised Duchy of Brunswick. During an absence by Duke Ernst August and his wife, Princess Viktoria Louise of Prussia, for a solemn celebration of the sovereign's birthday at the family's winter residence of Cumberland Castle in Upper Austria, violence and fighting broke out on the streets on the capital. The small statelet has been engulfed by the general strike for months, and yet the Minister-President, Werner Küchenthal, refused to make any concessions to the socialist movement. In spite of these vast historic class tensions and a past attempt at revolution in 1918, the government and political system remained conservative, refusing to implement universal suffrage and clutching onto a system of plural voting to contain the growth of Social Democrats and the far left.\n\nOver time, however, secret armament of worker self-defence groups in Brunswick and defections from the small Brunswickian garrison turned the tide in favour of the strikers, and yet another police raid at midnight in November led to a sudden violent response from the workers. The police and garrison were defeated in street clashes, barricades were erected and the revolutionaries occupied several public buildings, including the police headquarters, railway station and the prisons. Küchenthal's government fled from the Duchy, and the leader of the Brunswicker KAPD, Rudolf Lindau, has proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic of Brunswick off the steps of Brunswick Palace."

The Maulkuerfgesetz was endorsed by the \"Fundamentalist\" faction of the party, championed by priest and party ideologue Jean-Baptiste Esch, who believe that the Party of the Right should form a single party state on the principles of Political Catholicism and the collaboration of the social classes. It is known that President of the Council Joseph Bech is sympathetic to their ideas as well, and so are many in the Party — after all, they live on the border with the Commune, and few in Germany fear French revolutionary belligerence more than they do.\n\nStrengthened and emboldened by the passing of the Maulkuerfgesetz, the Fundamentalists have increased their hold upon the party and pushed through several additional reforms in Luxembourg — all parties besides the Party of the Right have been severely restricted, a government controlled Christian trade union was established and all independent unions were banned, and freedom of the press has been restricted. Luxembourg is becoming an authoritarian regime — as the Frankfurter Zeitung described, it is \"a dictatorial ulcer in the heart of Germany\"."
 germany_swr_events.4.d: "Now that the black-white-red front is in power, the Zentrum Party has an important key role to play.

The newly-elected conservative-federalist leadership of the Zentrum Party around Schäffer welcomes the appointment of the Kleist government, despite a certain degree of party-internal opposition. Schäffer himself has lauded the nationalists' united efforts against the Schleicher administration to prevent pseudo-revolutionary experiments and military-imposed centralisation attempts, and expressed his hope that the new government will take a tougher line than previous governments in defending both Germany's domestic order and the European order in the name of international peacekeeping."

Within the Christian Trade Unions, fears have become loud that certain reactionary circles within the DkP and DVLP could work towards a reversal of many hard-won labour laws. Stegerwald himself tolerates our government for now, but will keep a close eye on our future labour policy programme - the wrong decisions could cost us the silent support of one of the Empire's most powerful mass organisations."

Similar rhetoric flies from the entrepreneur's allies in the Reichstag, which has received a handful of new members thanks to this propaganda drive.\n\nTo the national revolutionary leadership of the DVLP, and Hassell in particular, this initiative poses a threat more than a boon. The relentless focus of the Hugenberg press on their owner's persona, with only cursory mentions of his role within the DVLP, raises concerns about his motives; it is hard to ignore the fact that he is building up his personal reputation.

 germany_swr_events.92.d: "Decadence is has permeated not only the Hohenzollerns for decades, but also a majority of the aristocracy, right down to the most impoverished landed gentry. How can the Second Estate still assume their divine responsibility of acting as idols for the common man? It's no wonder that today's youth are seen as particularly spoiled, they lack people they can look up to! The veneration of role models begins at the village level; the lord of the local manor is more likely to serve as an identification figure for the simple farmhand than the Kaiser in far-away Berlin. Kleist is certain that there is a need for pioneers who lead the way to bring about a change of mind among the nobility.\n\nLuckily, such a pioneer happens to live not too far from Gut Schmenzin: Kleist's aunt Ruth von Kleist-Retzow of the neighbouring Klein Krössin estate, elderly matriarch of the Kleist family and Pomerania's most famous female Junker. Throughout her life, Ruth, who shares most of the religious-idealist ideas of her Schmenzin relative, has written a plethora of guidebooks about the nobility's obligations, the most famous being \"The Responsibility of Landed Property in This Social Crisis\". Here, she stresses that large-scale land ownership brings not only privileges, but also responsibilities.\n\nAs the \"little king\" of his small community, the Junker must care for the well-being of his subordinates, for example by providing funds to increase local healthcare and accommodation standards for his agricultural workers and farmhands; to quote Ruth, \"A landowner who affords a car, but not a community nurse, is not worthy of the estate that God has given to him!\"\n\nOur recent reforms should relieve the Junkers and detach them slightly from the capitalist framework while preventing rural exodus to the cities more resolutely. Only without profit-related considerations in mind, the Junker class will be able to assume its ancient responsibilities again. The writings of Ruth von Kleist-Retzow should be mandatory literature in every noble household - in the long term, this will not only strengthen the ties between Junkers and rural workers, but will also turn the Prussian countryside into a reliable bulwark of stalwart tradition."
 germany_swr_events.99.t: "Death of Kuno von Westarp"
 germany_swr_events.99.d: "Today, Germany mourns the passing of Kuno von Westarp, long-time leader of the Conservative Party, who peacefully died at the age of 81. Though retaining the title of First Chairman until his death, Westarp assumed a subordinate role ever since the chairman elections of 1939, dedicating himself mostly to scholarly pursuits, most recently a comprehensive volume on conservative politics during the Wilhelmine Era.\n\nThe political legacy of the old-conservative titan is legendary. Defamed by his opponents as an archetypical Junker who adopted a pragmatic disguise after the introduction of the March Constitution to preserve the Conservatives' standing, Westarp was in fact a quite complex figure. Born into a modest family of rural gentry, without vast estates to his name, Westarp ascended the political ladder through sheer diligence and merit within the civil service, avoiding traditional avenues of power, wealth, or familial connections. Thus, unlike his genuine Junker colleagues, his convictions stemmed not from agrarian lobby interests but from an intrinsic loyalty to the monarchy and the Prussian civil service.\n\nAlthough Westarp's allegiance to such old-fashioned ideals meant that he was never able to detach himself from the 19th century's Bismarckian mindset, his guidance ensured the Conservative Party's survival at pivotal moments in recent history. Under the banner of "Applied Conservatism," he revitalised the party, bringing it to the forefront of politics again and dominating the landscape throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Initially sceptical of the Black-White-Red coalition, Westarp eventually found his role within the "new" Germany that has arisen throughout the last decade - primarily as an internal opponent to the national revolutionary ideas of Hassell and his associates.\n\nRegardless of one's personal opinions on Westarp, his enormous mark on conservative ideology during the 1910s, 20s, and 30s is undeniable. But while influential in his time, his way of thinking is now a relic of the past. A new era of conservatism has begun, and only the future will show what will become of Westarp's political legacy."

Not all of Zentrum's deputies will follow through - the federalist conservatives in Bavaria, Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg and the circle around the Westphalian landowner Franz von Papen will likely stay with us regardless - but who knows if that will be enough?"
 germany_swr_events.103.d: "The government's new policy, improving relations with the states and supporting ones with friendly conservative governments, has raised Zentrum's attention. Powerful on the state level, it leads several state governments, including all three of the southern states - Baden, Wurttemberg and Bavaria. These states would, understandably, love federal help for various local development projects. Pork barrel spending, as the Americans would call it.\n\nThe Zentrum deputies demand their governments to be given preference for federal support to state governments, and are especially vehement on this - should we refuse them, it is possible that they will destroy the coalition with the intention of reforming a more friendly center-right coalition."
 germany_spd_events.391.t: "Formation of the All-Democratic Front"
 germany_spd_events.391.d: "After a brief respite, the Reichstag has once again become a battleground between democratic forces and reactionary elements seeking to subvert the will of the people. With the threat of an authoritarian coup looming ever larger, Chancellor Müller has called for a united front of all democratic parties, trade unions, and civil society organizations. This "All-Democratic Front" is not merely a coalition of convenience, but a pledge to defend the Reich's fragile democracy against those who would see it undone. Liberals, social democrats, and progressive activists have for the most part agreed—however uneasily—to put aside their differences in the face of this renewed threat."
 germany_spd_events.391.a: "Now this is solidarity!"
 germany_flavour_events.13.d: "After a reign of over 53 years, Prince Friedrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont has peacefully passed away today at age 81. Despite his lacking charisma and barely existent political legacy, Friedrich achieved what many German monarchs have dreamt of: he is now officially the longest-reigning sovereign in the 75 years-long history of the German Empire, surpassing even the legendary Wilhelm II by just a few weeks, something that probably makes the \"Eternal Kaiser\" turn in his grave.\n\nThe great insignificance of Prince Friedrich can be attributed not only to the fact that Waldeck is one of Germany's smallest and least populous constituent states, but also to Waldeck's extreme dependency on Prussia. Due to a controversial treaty signed in 1867 as the principality was not able to cover the yearly matricular contributions every member state has to pay, the prince was turned into an irrelevant figurehead, while the internal administration was taken over by the Prussians from nearby Kassel and Hanover. On several occasions, outright dissolution of Waldeck-Pyrmont was on the table, in parts because activists in Bad Pyrmont, who have not much in common with their rulers in Arolsen, called for a unification with the Province of Hanover, but these plans always came to nothing.\n\nIt will be the duty of Friedrich's son, Prince Josias of Waldeck-Pyrmont, to steer the tiny principality through a new era."
 germany_flavour_events.31.d: "Plans for a reform to the Imperial Constitution have been drafted ever since the formation of the Demokratische Union coalition in 1936 — and now, with the end of the Second Weltkrieg, they may finally be put into place. Though the Kaiser had little to do with it (and is in fact opposed to many of the proposals for the constitutional reform), the term \"Wilhelmine Constitution\" has already begun floating throughout the press and civil society. After all, it would be the crowning achievement of the Wilhelmine Era - it may have begun with the Personal Regiment of the Kaiser and the tyranny of the OHL during the First Weltkrieg, but it ended with a victory for the democratic process and became synonymous with the parliamentarisation of the Empire.\n\nThe end result has surprised even radical social democrats in the left wing of the SPD. It turns out that an successful negotiation process allowed the SPD to bend all of its coalition partners to accept pretty much all of its demands - the government system has been fully parliamentarised, the powers of the reactionary states have been curtailed, and progressive reforms such as women's suffrage have been passed. Germany has, finally, entered the ranks of modern civilised states."
 germany_flavour_events.68.d5: "$germany_flavour_events.68.descstart$The German victory, once thought of as unimaginable, is unfortunately far more disturbing than anyone could have predicted.

 germany_flavour_events.84.h: "We have avenged a century of humiliation at last!"
 germany_flavour_events.87.d: "Ever since the excavation of the Chernyakhov site near Kyiv in 1901, the Chernyakhov culture has been established to refer to the inhabitants of modern day Ukraine and Romania during the Late Roman period. It has been of great interest to European prehistorians - the Russians see in it a possible precursor to the Slavs, others considered it Sarmatian. After 1918, German researchers could freely access the numerous archaeological sites in Ukraine, and with enough findings systemized, the prehistorian Paul Reinecke has come forward with a convincing hypothesis - the Chernyakhov culture corresponds to the legendary Gothic kingdom of Oium.\n\nNumerous findings, from analogous ceramics to building construction, indicate that the Chernyakhov culture has been at least influenced by Germanic peoples to the north - fitting well into the history written by medieval Gothic historian Jordanes, who claims that after leaving Gothiscanza, the Goths settled in a fertile land in the south and created their own kingdom, ruled by Filimer. Reinecke himself has been modest in his claims, but other, more patriotic German historians have taken his theories further. Claiming that there is little archeological proof of later migrations into the region, some claim that the Gothic population of Ukraine persisted on a large scale for a longer period than initially suggested - after all, we know that remnants of this Germanic population survived in Crimea over a thousand years after the reign of King Filimer.\n\nThis would, in turn, imply that the modern day Ukrainians are not originally Slavic and thus the 'triune Russian nation' idea promoted by Russian imperialists is a myth - rather, they are assimilated Germans, and should naturally stay with their origin country rather than return to the Russian colonial fold."
 germany_flavour_events.96.t: "Democratic Self-Defense" # Schleicher and SWR
 germany_flavour_events.96.d: "With the leadership of the SPD seemingly impotently unable to muster any resistance to the conservative regime beyond protest in the Reichstag, a handful of Social Democratic activists have taken matters to their own hands. A so-called 'Democratic Self-Defense' (Demokratische Notwehr) was established by left-wing veterans in Magdeburg, attracting activists from the SPD Young Turks, Socialist Party members and even radicalized trade unionists from local chapters of FAUD. It was led by Member of the Reichstag Karl Höltermann, himself a Weltkrieg veteran and journalist.\n\nThe organization's intention was to serve as the paramilitary arm of the 'all-German democratic movement', supposedly transcending party boundaries, although it was social democratic in practice. However, it was short-lived. The Prussian Secret Police infiltrated the organisation from the beginning, and the reactionary government in Prussia ordered it to be banned on the grounds of 'sheltering Syndicalist activists'. Faced with the full power of the state, the Self-Defense could not defend itself and surrendered without a fight. Six hundred arrests followed, including that of Höltermann and several other notable Magdeburg SPD leaders.\n\nWhat little motivation there was among the German social democrats to resist with force has been crushed. Their passivity and decades-long desperation to integrate into the political establishment have made them completely impotent when the call for resistance came."
 GER_polish_list_not_happy_tt: "This will worsen our relations with the Polish National Democrats in the §YMinority Bloc§!."
 germany_flavour_events.100.d: "Today, two deputies in the Social Democratic Group in the Reichstag, Józef Biniszkiewicz and Franciszek Trąbalski, announced their immediate departure from the group as well as from the majority. Both of them are not members of the SPD, but rather of the Polish Socialist Party of the Prussian Partition, which formed an electoral agreement with the SPD during the 1936 election campaign and won two constituencies in Upper Silesia.\n\nThe beginning of republican revolution in Poland has reignited the PPS zp's leaders' nationalist sympathies and alienated them from the government completely. After loud, furious speeches in the Reichstag where the two deputies demanded immediate political and economic independence for Poland, a withdrawal of the 'occupation forces' and 'to take the Kaiser's son back to Germany and allow the Polish people to decide their own fate', they joined the opposition. The Prussian Secret Police has already begun investigations into their possible connections with the Polish nationalist underground.\n\nUnfortunate, but perhaps we should have known this would happen, after all, the PPS split from the SPD once... twice... thrice..."
 germany_flavour_events.104.d1: "The conference has voted for Max Seydewitz, Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. A surprising choice, it is a clear example of the growing strength of the left wing of the SPD - he was most strongly promoted by Secretary of Education Otto Grotewohl as well as the left-leaning Socialist Youth, though he also garnered surprising support among the veteran theoreticians of the SPD. The party's revisionists and rightists are nervous, but have accepted the result for now.\n\nSeydewitz's acceptance speech makes it clear that he intends to promote the SPD's Marxist, socialist roots, even in the post-syndicalist age, and will focus on organising the youth and the rank-and-file members of the Party. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 germany_flavour_events.104.d2: "The conference has voted for Wilhelm Sollmann, Member of the Reichstag and Under-Secretary of the Interior, as Haubach's co-Chairman. Considered to be a member of the right wing of the party, he has been described by a few as a 'neo-Staatspolitiker', a pragmatist in the same vein as Otto Braun and Carl Severing, and also has a nationalist streak, such as his support for pan-Germanism. Liberal newspapers claim that Sollmann's victory, especially promoted by Braun, Severing and the other revisionists, happened in response to the SPD's very troubling time in the Demokratische Union government, including a significant marginalisation of the left.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Sollmann focused on the necessity of cooperation between the Social Democrats and the other pragmatic, pro-democratic forces in the country - the SPD needs to continue displaying its pragmatic credentials and show that it remains capable of leading the country. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 germany_flavour_events.104.d3: "The conference has voted for Adolf Schärf, formerly member of the parliament of Austria, later Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. With Austria's recent integration into the German Empire, the Austrian SDAP has integrated itself into the SPD, quickly becoming one of the party's largest branches - and they actively demanded an Austrian co-chairman ever since their integration. It appears that their demands have been met.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Schärf focused on the need for a 'full unification of Germany' spiritually and culturally, while also repeated his firm alignment to the Social Democratic party program. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 germany_flavour_events.104.d4: "The conference has voted for Fritz Baade, trade union official and Member of the Reichstag, as Haubach's co-Chairman. In the Social Democratic Party, he is most famous for being the co-author of the Tarnow-Baade Plan, which, in spite of initial reservations, was adopted by the SPD during their time in government and led to an impressive economic recovery. Also known as the party's foremost expert on agriculture, Baade was crucial in formulating the party's response to the German agrarian crisis.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Baade put most emphasis on the claim that the SPD is a party for the workers first and foremost - and then criticised the party's 'intellectual core' for spending too much time 'theorizing' instead of helping the working class. Needless to say, his memories of Rudolf Hilferding's scepticism towards the Tarnow-Baade Plan are behind his divisive claims. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."
 germany_flavour_events.104.d5: "The conference has voted for Fritz Naphtali as Haubach's co-Chairman. Known as Rudolf Hilferding's protege, Naphtali is one of the party's most influential economic theorists and a promoter of 'economic democracy', as well as a notable critic of the Tarnow-Baade Plan. His victory was easy to predict - among the party centre, he is perhaps the most prominent leader who is not one foot in the grave.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Naphtali focused on the future of the German economy, claiming that he will work on a new theory of economic democracy and a new party program which more adequately represents the conditions and needs of postwar Germany. He lodged criticism both towards the ADGB and their 'nationalist influences' as well as the 'intransigence' of the party left. Theodor Haubach's speech, in comparison, was a lot more curt, concerning itself more with the defense of democracy and the search for practical, democratic solutions for Germany in the postwar era."

 geregg.1.d: "The unthinkable has happened. The Imperial German Army has been defeated on the battlefield and is being driven deeper and deeper into the country, sacrificing millions of our citizens to the occupation of the syndicalist bloc and the Russian alliance. The mood in the country and its army varies. Many believe that the fall of the Empire is inevitable and wish to either save their skin or force the country to negotiate a crippling peace treaty, even though no hints of a negotiating mood can be seen among French and Russian leadership. Others, including the Reichskanzler, believe that the war can still be turned around, or that the front can be expanded by bringing in new allies which will relieve the pressure. Still others blame the government's weakness, declaring that it simply doesn't have what it takes to bring the nation to war footing. If it finally gave up on the pretenses of legalism and established a totalitarian dictatorship, it could muster the necessary resources to turn the war around.\n\nThe hopes of the doubters were crushed when the first rumours of the Kaiser's flight from the country began spreading throughout the streets of Berlin. The heart and soul of the Empire, the symbol of its rise to world supremacy, allegedly boarded a submarine with his family in order to escape to the colonies, or to a neutral country in South America - whatever his fate may be, he clearly did not have faith in Germany's ability to win the war. Even more damning were the suggestions that [GER.GetSecondInCommand] ordered [GER.GetLeader]'s escape as a part of a plan to set up a government in exile which could continue the fight in a manner similar to the Entente powers after their revolutions.\n\nSo, is it over?"

 geregg.2.t: "The Bauer Putsch"
 geregg.2.d: "During its time in power, the government of Reichskanzler [GER.GetSecondInCommand] allied with Die Fronde, a coalition of military leaders and reformers who envisioned a totalitarian, nationalistic reconstruction of the Imperial German Army. These same leaders were among the first to question the government's less than stellar leadership during the War — meanwhile, at the same time, they desired an assertive authoritarian dictatorship which would immediately mobilise all of the Empire's resources for the war effort. They found allies — numerous young officers inspired by totalitarian, far-right ideologies who were certain that they could turn the course of war around as long as they were given power; then, contact with Max Bauer, the last of the leaders of the old Ludendorff clique during the first Weltkrieg. A retired general highly respected by the Die Fronde, both due to his immense political and organisational talent and his management of the Hindenburg Programme during the war, he was selected as the public face of their conspiracy.\n\nA putsch was organised in Berlin, in which the old government was overthrown and detained by Army officers. The Reichstag, Bundesrat and Prussian legislature were all dissolved, and a series of emergency decrees declared Bauer \"the supreme commander of the German Empire and leader of the National Salvation government\". Waldemar Pabst, his co-conspirator, became his second in command, and the putsch received the endorsement of other hardliners - Eugen von Schobert, Walter von Reichenau, Wilhelm List, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, Franz von Epp and Georg Lindemann, among others.\n\nBut will this be any more than Germany's dying gasp?"

The Imperial German Army has been defeated on the battlefield and is being driven deeper and deeper into the country, sacrificing millions of our citizens to the occupation of the syndicalist bloc and the Russian alliance. The mood in the country is pessimistic. The democratisation of the Empire since 1936 has also led to a reasonable, though modest growth to Germany's radical socialist movements - which have been emboldened even more by the Army's defeats at the front. For some, it seems certain that the only way Germany can survive is if it surrenders, and the only way it can surrender is if it topples the reactionary monarchist regime.\n\nSo, today, the blow to the German monarchy has been struck. Spontaneous revolts, instigated by the FAUD and SP with participation from the National-Syndicalists, begun throughout Berlin and the other major cities, the first workers' councils have been set up, intending to wrestle power from the state and pave the way to a syndicalist revolution. Naturally, law enforcement and reserve divisions responded with force. Street clashes have begun throughout Berlin.\n\nHowever, the Kaiser did not stay to get overthrown or, worse, lynched by the furious crowds. The heart and soul of the Empire, the symbol of its rise to world supremacy, allegedly boarded a submarine with his family in order to escape to the colonies, or to a neutral country in South America - whatever his fate may be, he clearly did not have faith in Germany's ability to win the war.\n\nSo, is it over?"

A \"German Republic\" was declared by Reichskanzler [GER.GetSecondInCommand] from the balcony of the Reichstag building, where the politician also promised a hasty peace and the establishment of immediate reforms for the betterment of the protesting working class - though neither of them seem likely to get implemented, owing to the geopolitical situation.\n\nAn emergency committee chaired by the Reichskanzler, who has become the de facto head of state, and fellow Social Democratic politician Hans Vogel was established. Their first priority is to maintain the faith of the army, somehow, and either find a way to turn the war around or make the subsequent death of the German Empire as painless as possible - that is, if it is even possible.\n\nBut will this be any more than Germany's dying gasp?"

We shall not allow ourselves to become soft like our predecessors were — the French and the Russians, as well as the thousands who betrayed Germany during its darkest hour will receive their due. A question arises, however — what shall be the future of our regime? The General, Max Bauer, took power merely as leader of an emergency government to save Germany in its darkest hour, after all.\n\nOur loyalty has always been to the monarchy, and the Hohenzollerns could be reinvited to Germany to assume their throne again. However, they disgraced themselves by abandoning the nation when it needed them most, and so, if we do choose to restore the monarchy, we should choose a puppet we can control — the grandson of Wilhelm II, Prince Wilhelm, should serve our purposes well in spite of his wavering sympathies to our ideology.\n\nAlternatively, the betrayal of the Hohenzollern family may indicate the need for a more direct hand — our \"New Germany\" shall be led by a suitable great man given the title Reichsverweser, whose command is completely unquestioned, until a suitable Kaiser can be crowned."
